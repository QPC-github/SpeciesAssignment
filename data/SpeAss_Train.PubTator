10189359|t|Identification and expression of delta-isoforms of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in failing and nonfailing human myocardium.
10189359|a|Despite its importance for the regulation of heart function, little is known about the isoform expression of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) in human myocardium. In this study, we investigated the spectrum of CaMKII isoforms delta2, delta3, delta4, delta8, and delta9 in human striated muscle tissue. Isoform delta3 is characteristically expressed in cardiac muscle. In skeletal muscle, specific expression of a new isoform termed delta11 is demonstrated. Complete sequencing of human delta2 cDNA, representing all common features of the investigated CaMKII subclass, revealed its high homology to the corresponding rat cDNA. Comparative semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses from left ventricular tissues of normal hearts and from patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy showed a significant increase in transcript levels of isoform delta3 relative to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in diseased hearts (101. 6+/-11.0% versus 64.9+/-9.9% in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=6). Transcript levels of the other investigated cardiac CaMKII isoforms remained unchanged. At the protein level, by using a subclass-specific antibody, we observed a similar increase of a delta-CaMKII-specific signal (7.2+/-1.0 versus 3.8+/-0.7 optical density units in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=4 through 6). The diseased state of the failing hearts was confirmed by a significant increase in transcript levels for atrial natriuretic peptide (292. 9+/-76.4% versus 40.1+/-3.2% in the nonfailing group; P < 0.05, n=3 through 6). Our data characterize for the first time the delta-CaMKII isoform expression pattern in human hearts and demonstrate changes in this expression pattern in heart failure.

10226785|t|Cloning and sequencing of the complete cDNA encoding the human insulin receptor related receptor.
10226785|a|The insulin receptor related receptor (IRR) is a heterotetrameric transmembrane receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. The IRR shares large homology with the insulin and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) receptor with regard to amino acid sequence and protein structure. So far, only a partial human sequence containing the complete 3' end has been reported, although the full-length human IRR cDNA had been used for transfection studies and functional analysis of the receptor. We have isolated a full-length human IRR cDNA and report on the 5' translated and untranslated region of the human IRR gene. The full length IRR sequence contains 4150 bases and shares a high degree of homology with the guinea pig IRR cDNA sequence and rat IRR sequences that had been reported earlier on by others. Sequencing of the IRR cDNA revealed that the human IRR cDNA contains 341 bases corresponding to the IRR 5' end in addition to the bases that had been reported on before. Also, this sequence contains the start codon of translation. The full length cDNA for the human IRR can now be used for functional expression studies and to elucidate the nature of the ligand for this receptor type.

10441506|t|Identification and characterization of PKNbeta, a novel isoform of protein kinase PKN: expression and arachidonic acid dependency are different from those of PKNalpha.
10441506|a|The cDNA clone encoding a novel isoform of protein kinase PKN, termed PKNbeta, was isolated from a HeLa cDNA library. PKNbeta had high sequence homology with PKNalpha, originally isolated PKN, especially in the repeats of charged amino acid-rich region with leucine-zipper like sequences (CZ region/HR1), in the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain, and in approximately 130 amino acid stretch (D region/HR2), located between CZ region/HR1 and the catalytic domain. However, the amino acid sequence of PKNbeta differed from that of PKNalpha in the region immediately amino-terminal to the catalytic domain, which contained two distinct proline-rich sequences consistent with the class II consensus sequence, PXXPXR, for binding to SH3 domain. Distribution of PKNbeta differed from that of PKNalpha in the following two respects: (1) Northern blotting indicated that PKNbeta mRNA could not be detected in human adult tissues, but was expressed abundantly in human cancer cell lines; (2) immunochemical analysis indicated that PKNbeta localized in nucleus and perinuclear Golgi apparatus, and was almost absent in cytoplasmic region in NIH3T3 cells. Recombinant PKNbeta expressed in COS7 cells displayed autophosphorylation and peptide kinase activity, but was found to be significantly less responsive to arachidonic acid than PKNalpha. The identification of this novel isoform underscores the diversity of PKN signaling pathway.

10484773|t|A common polymorphic allele of the human luteinizing hormone beta-subunit gene: additional mutations and differential function of the promoter sequence.
10484773|a|A common genetic variant (V) of the human luteinizing hormone (LH) beta-subunit gene was recently discovered. The V-LH molecules have higher bioactivity in vitro, but shorter half-life in circulation, which apparently is related to the alterations of LH function observed in individuals homo- and heterozygous for the V-LHbeta allele. We have now studied whether additional mutations in the V-LHbeta promoter sequence could contribute to the altered physiology of the LH variant molecules. The 661 bp 5'-flanking region of the V-LHbeta gene, retrieved from human genomic DNA by PCR, contained eight single-nucleotide changes, as compared with the wild-type (wt) LHbeta promoter. The finding was consistent in DNA samples of different ethnic groups. Reporter constructs with various lengths of the wt- and V-LH promoter sequences, driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene, were transfected into an immortalized mouse pituitary cell line, LbetaT(2), known to express the endogenous LHbeta gene, and into a non-endocrine human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK 293. Basal expression levels of the V-LHbeta promoter constructs were on average 36% higher in LbetaT(2)cells ( P < 0.001; n = 29), and 40% higher in HEK 293 cells ( P < 0.001; n = 16), as compared with the respective wt sequences. Numerous qualitative and quantitative differences were found between the two cell lines in responses of the two promoter sequences to stimulation with 12- O -tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP, progesterone and gonado- tropin-releasing hormone. In conclusion, the V-LHbeta promoter has higher basal activity, and differs in response to hormonal stimulation, as compared with the wt-LHbeta promoter. The altered promoter function of the V-LHbeta gene provides evidence for differences in regulation of the wt- and V-LHbeta genes, which may contribute to the differences observed in pituitary-gonadal function between carriers of the two LHbeta alleles. The findings also suggest a novel evolutionary mechanism whereby polymorphic changes resulting in altered bioactivity of a gene product may be compensated for by additional mutations in the cognate promoter sequence, changing transcription of the same gene.

10484778|t|Ectodysplasin is a collagenous trimeric type II membrane protein with a tumor necrosis factor-like domain and co-localizes with cytoskeletal structures at lateral and apical surfaces of cells.
10484778|a|Anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) is a human genetic disorder of impaired ectodermal appendage development. The EDA gene encodes isoforms of a novel transmembrane protein, ectodysplasin. The sequence of the longest isoform includes an interrupted collagenous domain of 19 Gly-X-Y repeats and a motif conserved in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related ligand family. In order to understand better the function of the ectodysplasin protein molecule and its domains, we have studied the processing and localization of wild-type and mutated isoforms in transfected human fetal kidney 293 and monkey kidney COS-1 cells. Similar to other members of collagenous membrane proteins and members of TNF-related ligands, ectodysplasin is a type II membrane protein and it forms trimers. The membrane localization of ectodysplasin is asymmetrical: it is found on the apical and lateral surfaces of the cells where it co-localizes with cytoskeletal structures. The TNF-like motif and cysteines found near the C-terminus are necessary for correct transport to the cell membrane, but the intracellular and collagenous domains are not required for the localization pattern. Our results suggest that ectodysplasin is a new member in the TNF-related ligand family involved in the early epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that regulates ectodermal appendage formation.

10639512|t|BCAR1, a human homologue of the adapter protein p130Cas, and antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cells.
10639512|a|BACKGROUND: Treatment of breast cancer with the antiestrogen tamoxifen is effective in approximately one half of the patients with estrogen receptor-positive disease, but tumors recur frequently because of the development of metastases that are resistant to tamoxifen. We have previously shown that mutagenesis of human estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells by insertion of a defective retrovirus genome caused the cells to become antiestrogen resistant. In this study, we isolated and characterized the crucial gene at the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1) locus. METHODS/RESULTS: Transfer of the BCAR1 locus from retrovirus-mutated, antiestrogen-resistant cells to estrogen-dependent ZR-75-1 cells by cell fusion conferred an antiestrogen-resistant phenotype on the recipient cells. The complete coding sequence of BCAR1 was isolated by use of exon-trapping and complementary DNA (cDNA) library screening. Sequence analysis of human BCAR1 cDNA predicted a protein of 870 amino acids that was strongly homologous to rat p130Cas-adapter protein. Genomic analysis revealed that BCAR1 consists of seven exons and is located at chromosome 16q23.1. BCAR1 transcripts were detected in multiple human tissues and were similar in size to transcripts produced by retrovirus-mutated ZR-75-1 cells. Transfection of BCAR1 cDNA into ZR-75-1 cells again resulted in sustained cell proliferation in the presence of antiestrogens, confirming that BCAR1 was the responsible gene in the locus. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of the BCAR1 gene confers antiestrogen resistance on human ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Overexpression of BCAR1 in retrovirus-mutated cells appears to result from activation of the gene's promoter. The isolation and characterization of this gene open new avenues to elucidating mechanisms by which the growth of human breast cancer becomes independent of estrogen.

10684944|t|Cloning and characterisation of the Sry-related transcription factor gene Sox8.
10684944|a|SOX proteins form a large family of transcription factors related by a DNA-binding domain known as the HMG box. Some 30 Sox genes have been identified in mammals and orthologues have been found in a wide range of other metazoans. Sox genes are highly conserved and are known to play important roles in embryonic development, including roles in gonadal, central nervous system, neural crest and skeletal development. Several SOX genes have been implicated in human congenital diseases. We report here the isolation of Sox8 and its characterisation in mice and humans. This gene has a remarkably similar primary structure and genomic organisation to the campomelic dysplasia gene SOX9 and the Waardenburg-Shah syndrome gene SOX10. SOX8 protein is able to bind to canonical SOX target DNA sequences and activate transcription in vitro through two separate trans -activation regions. Further, Sox8 is expressed in the central nervous system, limbs, kidneys, gonads and craniofacial structures during mouse embryo development. Sox8 maps to the t complex on mouse chromosome 17 and to human chromosome 16p13.3, a region associated with the microphthalmia-cataract syndrome CATM and the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome ATR-16.

10715554|t|Human follicle stimulating hormone receptor variants lacking transmembrane domains display altered post-translational conformations.
10715554|a|Variant splicing of gonadotropin receptor mRNA commonly occurs, however expression of receptor protein variants and their trafficking has yet to be studied in detail. To determine receptor variant trafficking and intracellular processing in mammalian cells, the intracellular fate of intentionally truncated variants of human follicle stimulating hormone receptor (hFSH-R) expressed in CHO cells was examined. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were made against the hFSH-R's extracellular domain (ECD) expressed in insect cells. Four mAbs 106.156, 106.290, 106.318, and 106.263 were chosen as probes. Epitope mapping using synthetic peptides, and truncated hFSH-R variants revealed that mAb 106.156 bound to ECD residues 183-220, while mAbs 106.318, 106.290, 106.263 bound ECD residues 300-331. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that mAbs 106.318 and 106.156 stained the surface of fixed, intact CHO cells expressing wild type hFSH-R. However, following cell permeabilization all four antibodies stained hFSH-R in Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. Permeabilized cells expressing truncated variants ECD213 and ECD254 showed staining accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope continuum. ECD335/His was found to accumulate in extended endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER location of ECD335/His was confirmed by double labeling experiments with concanavalin A and ECD mAb. Glycosidase digestion followed by Western blot analysis show ECD213 and ECD335/His to be glycosylated, but not ECD254. Both glycosylated truncated hFSH-R variants were sensitive to peptide-N-glycanase F and endoglycosidase H but insensitive to neuraminidase indicating that these variants possess high mannose type oligosaccharides. Thus truncated hFSH-R variants do not reach the medial or trans Golgi where high mannose oligosaccharides are trimmed and sialic acid is added. These data suggest that the conformation the ECD of the wild type receptor is different from the ECD alone expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. This information suggests that the ECD serves two distinct roles; the first is to bind FSH and the other is likely to contact the endodomain of the receptor, which presumably leads to activation of the endodomain for signal transduction.

10722718|t|The pro-alpha3(V) collagen chain. Complete primary structure, expression domains in adult and developing tissues, and comparison to the structures and expression domains of the other types V and XI procollagen chains.
10722718|a|The low abundance fibrillar collagen type V is widely distributed in tissues as an alpha1(V)(2)alpha2(V) heterotrimer that helps regulate the diameters of fibrils of the abundant collagen type I. Mutations in the alpha1(V) and alpha2(V) chain genes have been identified in some cases of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), in which aberrant collagen fibrils are associated with connective tissue fragility, particularly in skin and joints. Type V collagen also exists as an alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimer that has remained poorly characterized chiefly due to inability to obtain the complete primary structure or nucleic acid probes for the alpha3(V) chain or its biosynthetic precursor, pro-alpha3(V). Here we provide human and mouse full-length pro-alpha3(V) sequences. Pro-alpha3(V) is shown to be closely related to the alpha1(V) precursor, pro-alpha1(V), but with marked differences in N-propeptide sequences, and collagenous domain features that provide insights into the low melting temperature of alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimers, lack of heparin binding by alpha3(V) chains and the possibility that alpha1(V)alpha2(V)alpha3(V) heterotrimers are incorporated into heterotypic fibrils. In situ hybridization of mouse embryos detects alpha3(V) expression primarily in the epimysial sheaths of developing muscles and within nascent ligaments adjacent to forming bones and in joints. This distribution, and the association of alpha1(V), alpha2(V), and alpha3(V) chains in heterotrimers, suggests the human alpha3(V) gene COL5A3 as a candidate locus for at least some cases of classical EDS in which the alpha1(V) and alpha2(V) genes have been excluded, and for at least some cases of the hypermobility type of EDS, a condition marked by gross joint laxity and chronic musculoskeletal pain. COL5A3 is mapped to 19p13.2 near a polymorphic marker that should be useful in analyzing linkage with EDS and other disease phenotypes.

10753868|t|A G protein-coupled receptor for UDP-glucose.
10753868|a|Uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) has a well established biochemical role as a glycosyl donor in the enzymatic biosynthesis of carbohydrates. It is less well known that UDP-glucose may possess pharmacological activity, suggesting that a receptor for this molecule may exist. Here, we show that UDP-glucose, and some closely related molecules, potently activate the orphan G protein-coupled receptor KIAA0001 heterologously expressed in yeast or mammalian cells. Nucleotides known to activate P2Y receptors were inactive, indicating the distinctly novel pharmacology of this receptor. The receptor is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues, including many regions of the brain. These data suggest that some sugar-nucleotides may serve important physiological roles as extracellular signaling molecules in addition to their familiar role in intermediary metabolism.

10753886|t|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 mutation alters P-type calcium channel function.
10753886|a|Abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with a predominant loss of the Purkinje cell. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from mouse Purkinje cells revealed a predominant expression of the alpha1A channel lacking an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in the domain IV (alpha1A(-NP)). Human alpha1A channels carrying various polyglutamine length with or without NP were expressed in HEK293 cells, and channel properties were compared using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique. alpha1A(-NP), corresponding to P-type channel, with 24 and 28 polyglutamines found in patients showed the voltage dependence of inactivation shifting negatively by 6 and 11 mV, respectively, from the 13 polyglutamine control. Contrarily, the alpha1A channel with NP (alpha1A(+NP)), corresponding to Q-type channel, with 28 polyglutamines exhibited a positive shift of 5 mV. These results suggest that altered function of alpha1A(-NP) may contribute to degeneration of Purkinje cells, which express predominantly alpha1A(-NP), due to the reduced Ca(2+) influx resulting from the negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation. On the other hand, other types of neurons, expressing both alpha1A(-NP) and alpha1A(+NP), may survive because the positive shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of alpha1A(+NP) compensates Ca(2+) influx.

10773454|t|Structure, mapping and expression of the human gene encoding the homeodomain protein, SIX2.
10773454|a|Vertebrate genes with sequence similarity to the Drosophila homeobox gene, sine oculis (so), constitute the SIX family. There is notable expression of members of this family in anterior neural structures, and several SIX genes have been shown to play roles in vertebrate and insect development, or have been implicated in maintenance of the differentiated state of tissues. Mutations in three of these genes in man (SIX5, SIX6 and SIX3) are associated with severe phenotypes, and therefore, the cloning of other human genes from this family is of interest. We have cloned and characterised the gene that encodes human SIX2, elucidated its gene structure and conducted expression studies in a range of tissues. SIX2 is widely expressed in the late first-trimester fetus, but has a limited range of expression sites in the adult. The expression pattern of SIX2 and its localisation to chromosome 2p15-p16 will be of use in assessing its candidacy in human developmental disorders.

10873535|t|Expression, purification, and functional analysis of the human serine protease HtrA2.
10873535|a|HumHtrA2 or Omi is a recently described member of a novel family of mammalian serine proteases homologous to the Escherichia coli htrA gene product. Although the physiological function of members of this new family is unclear, the current understanding is that as well as being involved with the degradation aberrantly folded proteins during conditions of cellular stress, they may possess a chaperone-like role under normal conditions. In this report we describe the overexpression of humHtrA2 in two heterologous systems comparing the merits of each. We found that molecular analysis of processing events in Sf9 cells allowed us to revisit E. coli expression systems which were initially unsuccessful. Using E. coli we were able to produce milligram amounts of >90% pure recombinant enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE gels. By means of fluorescently labeled substrates alpha- and beta-casein and zymography, the proteolytic activity of recombinant HumHtrA2 was also demonstrated.

10908648|t|The human GRAF gene is fused to MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) and both alleles are disrupted in three cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia with a deletion 5q.
10908648|a|We have isolated the human GRAF gene (for GTPase regulator associated with the focal adhesion kinase pp125(FAK)). This gene was fused with MLL in a unique t(5;11)(q31;q23) that occurred in an infant with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. GRAF encodes a member of the Rho family of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. On the protein level, it is 90% homologous to the recently described chicken GRAF gene that functions as a GAP of RhoA in vivo and is thus a critical component of the integrin signaling transduction pathway. The particular position of the human GRAF gene at 5q31 and the proposed antiproliferative and tumor suppressor properties of its avian homologue suggest that it also might be pathogenetically relevant for hematologic malignancies with deletions of 5q. To investigate this possibility, we sequenced 4-5 individual cDNA clones from 13 cases in which one allele of GRAF was deleted. We found point mutations within the GAP domain of the second GRAF allele in one patient. In two additional patients we found an insertion of 52 or 74 bp within the GRAF cDNA that generates a reading frame shift followed by a premature stop codon. GRAF maps outside the previously defined commonly deleted 5q31 region. Nevertheless, inactivation of both alleles in at least some cases suggests that deletions and mutations of the GRAF gene may be instrumental in the development and progression of hematopoeitic disorders with a del(5q).

10915768|t|Ataxin-3, the MJD1 gene product, interacts with the two human homologs of yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, HHR23A and HHR23B.
10915768|a|Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract near the C-terminus of the MJD1 gene product, ataxin-3. The mutant ataxin-3 forms intranuclear inclusions in cultured cells as well as in diseased human brain and also causes cell death in transfected cells. However, the normal function of ataxin-3 remains unknown. To explore the function of ataxin-3, we used the two-hybrid system to screen for the protein(s) that interacts with ataxin-3. We found that ataxin-3 interacts with two human homologs of the yeast DNA repair protein RAD23, HHR23A and HHR23B. Furthermore, we confirmed that ataxin-3 interacts with the -ubiquitin-like domain at the N-terminus of the HHR23 proteins, which is important for nucleotide excision repair; however, ataxin-3 does not interact with -ubiquitin, implying that ataxin-3 might be functionally associated with the HHR23 proteins through this specific interaction. The normal and mutant ataxin-3 proteins show no difference in their ability to bind to the HHR23 proteins. However, in 293 cells HHR23A is recruited to intranuclear inclusions formed by the mutant ataxin-3 through its interaction with ataxin-3. These results suggest that this interaction is associated with the normal function of ataxin-3 and that some functional abnormality of the HHR23 proteins might exist in MJD.

10915776|t|Retinoschisin, the X-linked retinoschisis protein, is a secreted photoreceptor protein, and is expressed and released by Weri-Rb1 cells.
10915776|a|X-linked retinoschisis is characterized by microcystic-like changes of the macular region and schisis within the inner retinal layers, leading to visual deterioration in males. Many missense and protein-truncating mutations of the causative gene RS1 have now been identified and are thought to be inactivating. RS1 encodes a 224 amino acid protein, retinoschisin, which contains a discoidin domain but is of unknown function. We have generated a polyclonal antibody against a peptide from a unique region within retinoschisin, which detects a protein of approximately 28 kDa in retinal samples reduced with dithiothreitol, but multimers sized >40 kDa under non-reducing conditions. A screen of human tissues with this antibody reveals retinoschisin to be retina specific and the antibody detects a protein of similar size in bovine and murine retinae. We investigated the expression pattern in the retina of both RS1 mRNA (using in situ hybridization with riboprobes) and retinoschisin (using immunohistochemistry). The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA only in the photoreceptor layer but the protein product of the gene was present both in the photoreceptors and within the inner portions of the retina. Furthermore, differentiated retinoblastoma cells (Weri-Rb1 cells) were found to express RS1 mRNA and to release retinoschisin. These results suggest that retinoschisin is released by photo-receptors and has functions within the inner retinal layers. Thus, X-linked retinoschisis is caused by abnormalities in a putative secreted photoreceptor protein and is the first example of a secreted photo-receptor protein associated with a retinal dystrophy.

10942389|t|HIV-1 gp120- and gp160-induced apoptosis in cultured endothelial cells is mediated by caspases.
10942389|a|The immune dysfunction and cell destruction that occur in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected host appear to result from the direct cytopathic effects of viral infection and the effects of viral proteins on uninfected bystander cells. Recently, the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been reported to mediate apoptosis in neuronal cells and in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells after its binding to HIV-1 envelope proteins. In the current study, it was observed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) undergo apoptosis after their treatment with the HIV-1 envelope proteins gp120/160. Anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody decreased HIV-1 gp120/160-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the CXCR4 chemokine receptor mediates the apoptotic effects of these HIV envelope glycoproteins. Further studies revealed that caspases play an important role in this process because the pretreatment of cells with a general caspase enzyme inhibitor decreased the extent of HUVEC apoptosis induced by gp120/160. In addition, it was found that caspase-3 was activated on HIV-1 gp120/160 treatment of these cells. It was also observed that gp120/160 treatment slightly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax. These results suggest that HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins can disrupt endothelial integrity through the interaction with CXCR4, thereby facilitating virus transit out of the bloodstream and contributing to the vascular injury syndromes seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

11207365|t|A human BRCA2 complex containing a structural DNA binding component influences cell cycle progression.
11207365|a|Germline mutations of the human BRCA2 gene confer susceptibility to breast cancer. Although the function of the BRCA2 protein remains to be determined, murine cells homozygous for BRCA2 inactivation display chromosomal aberrations. We have isolated a 2 MDa BRCA2-containing complex and identified a structural DNA binding component, designated as BRCA2-Associated Factor 35 (BRAF35). BRAF35 contains a nonspecific DNA binding HMG domain and a kinesin-like coiled coil domain. Similar to BRCA2, BRAF35 mRNA expression levels in mouse embryos are highest in proliferating tissues with high mitotic index. Strikingly, nuclear staining revealed a close association of BRAF35/BRCA2 complex with condensed chromatin coincident with histone H3 phosphorylation. Importantly, antibody microinjection experiments suggest a role for BRCA2/BRAF35 complex in modulation of cell cycle progression.

11210186|t|Cloning, expression and chromosomal location of NKX6B TO 10Q26, a region frequently deleted in brain tumors.
11210186|a|Nkx6-2 (former Gtx) is a murine-homeobox-containing gene localized distally on Chromosome (Chr) 7. Analysis of the expression pattern, together with DNA binding assays, suggests that this gene product might be important for differentiated oligodendrocyte function and in the regulation of myelin gene expression. We now report on the cloning and characterization of the human homolog (NKX6B). DNA sequence analysis of an 11-kb genomic fragment revealed that the complete human gene spans 1.2 kb and is composed of three exons. NKX6B is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 277 amino acids with 97% identity to mouse Nkx6-2. Northern blot experiments showed that NKX6B expression is tightly controlled in a tissue-specific fashion with the highest site of expression being the brain. Finally, using STS content mapping and RH analyis, we demonstrated that NKX6B maps to the 10q26, a region where frequent loss of heterozygosity has been observed in various malignant brain tumors. These results may implicate NKX6B as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for brain tumors, particularly for oligodendrogliomas.

11461089|t|Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) upregulates BCL-2 and inhibits apoptosis in human and murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells.
11461089|a|Tumour progression is regulated by the balance of proliferation and apoptosis in the tumour cell population. To date, the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumour growth has been attributed to the induction of angiogenesis. VEGF has been shown to be a survival factor for endothelial cells, preventing apoptosis by inducing Bcl-2 expression. In both murine (4T1) and human (MDA-MB-231) metastatic mammary carcinoma cell lines, we found that VEGF upregulated Bcl-2 expression and anti-VEGF antibodies reduced Bcl-2 expression. These alterations in Bcl-2 expression were reflected by the levels of tumour cell apoptosis. VEGF resulted in reduced tumour cell apoptosis, whereas its inhibition with anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies induced apoptosis directly in tumour cells. Therefore, in addition to its role in angiogenesis and vessel permeability, VEGF acts as a survival factor for tumour cells, inducing Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting tumour cell apoptosis.

12117771|t|Protocadherin LKC, a new candidate for a tumor suppressor of colon and liver cancers, its association with contact inhibition of cell proliferation.
12117771|a|Protocadherins are a major subfamily of the cadherin superfamily, but little is known about their functions and intracellular signal transduction. We cloned a novel human protocadherin gene, containing seven EC domains, and identified functional aspects of this gene. The gene was predominantly expressed in liver, kidney and colon tissues, and was thus designated Protocadherin LKC. The expression of Protocadherin LKC is markedly reduced in cancers arising from these tissues at both transcriptional and protein levels. To investigate the effects of Protocadherin LKC expression in colon cancer, we introduced the gene into colon cancer cell line HCT116, which does not express this gene. Significantly, Protocadherin LKC expression induced contact inhibition of cell proliferation although it did not affect growth rate. When grown to post-confluence in monolayer cells cultures, Protocadherin LKC-expressing HCT116 no longer formed multiple cell layers and showed the typical paving stone morphology of normal epithelial cells. Furthermore, expression of Protocadherin LKC suppressed tumor formation of HCT116 cells in a nude mouse model. In addition, we identified a protein, hMAST205 (microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-205 kDa), which interacted with Protocadherin LKC; the interaction occurring between the PDZ domain of hMAST205 and C-terminal tail of Protocadherin LKC. Our results suggest that Protocadherin LKC, which directly binds PDZ protein, is a molecular switch for contact inhibition of epithelial cells in the liver, kidney and colon tissues.

1281549|t|Expression cloning of a human dual-specificity phosphatase.
1281549|a|Using an expression cloning strategy, we isolated a cDNA encoding a human protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. Bacteria expressing the kinase domain of the keratinocyte growth factor receptor (bek/fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) were infected with a fibroblast cDNA library in a phagemid prokaryotic expression vector and screened with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Among several clones showing decreased anti-phosphotyrosine recognition, one displayed phosphatase activity toward the kinase in vitro. The 4.1-kilobase cDNA encoded a deduced protein of 185 amino acids with limited sequence similarity to the vaccinia virus phosphatase VH1. The purified recombinant protein dephosphorylated several activated growth factor receptors, as well as serine-phosphorylated casein, in vitro. Both serine and tyrosine phosphatase activities were completely abolished by mutagenesis of a single cysteine residue conserved in VH1 and the VH1-related (VHR) human protein. These properties suggest that VHR is capable of regulating intracellular events mediated by both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation.

1324173|t|Characterization of SAF-A, a novel nuclear DNA binding protein from HeLa cells with high affinity for nuclear matrix/scaffold attachment DNA elements.
1324173|a|We identified four proteins in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells which specifically bind to a scaffold attachment region (SAR) element from the human genome. Of these four proteins, SAF-A (scaffold attachment factor A), shows the highest affinity for several homologous and heterologous SAR elements from vertebrate cells. SAF-A is an abundant nuclear protein and a constituent of the nuclear matrix and scaffold. The homogeneously purified protein is a novel double stranded DNA binding protein with an apparent molecular weight of 120 kDa. SAF-A binds at multiple sites to the human SAR element; competition studies with synthetic polynucleotides indicate that these sites most probably reside in the multitude of A/T-stretches which are distributed throughout this element. In addition we show by electron microscopy that the protein forms large aggregates and mediates the formation of looped DNA structures.

1329093|t|Expression cloning of a cDNA encoding UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3-GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 1-6GlcNAc transferase by gene transfer into CHO cells expressing polyoma large tumor antigen.
1329093|a|A cDNA encoding UDP-GlcNAc:Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-R (GlcNAc to GalNAc) beta 1-6GlcNAc transferase (EC 2.4.1.102), which forms critical branches in O-glycans, has been isolated by an expression cloning approach using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Increased activity of this enzyme and the concomitant occurrence of the O-glycan core 2 structure [Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc] has been observed in a variety of biological processes, such as T-cell activation and immunodeficiency due to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and AIDS. Since CHO cells do not express this enzyme, CHO cell lines were established to stably express polyoma large tumor (T) antigen, which enables transient expression cloning. Because the antibody used was found to detect most efficiently the oligosaccharide products attached to leukosialin, the CHO cells were also stably transfected with leukosialin cDNA. By using this particular CHO cell line, a cDNA that encodes a protein determining the formation of the core 2 structure was isolated from an HL-60 cDNA library. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein with type II membrane topology, as has been found for all other mammalian glycosyltransferases cloned to date. The expression of the presumed catalytic domain as a fusion protein with the IgG binding domain of protein A enabled us to demonstrate unequivocally that the cDNA encodes the core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6)GalNAc structures. No activity with this enzyme was detected toward the acceptors for other beta 1-6GlcNAc transferases.

1374453|t|Cloning of a novel tumor necrosis factor-alpha-inducible primary response gene that is differentially expressed in development and capillary tube-like formation in vitro.
1374453|a|TNF is a proinflammatory cytokine that has pleiotropic effects on cells and tissues, mediated in large part by alterations in target tissue gene expression. We have used the technique of differential hybridization to identify several primary response genes induced by TNF in human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells, a cell type that is profoundly activated by cytokine treatment. One of these cDNA, designated B94, detects a rapidly and transiently induced 4-kb transcript in TNF-treated HUVE cells, and this transcript is superinduced in the concomitant presence of cycloheximide. Other proinflammatory stimuli including IL-1 beta and LPS are also able to induce B94 mRNA expression. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that TNF induction of B94 transcript occurs primarily at the level of transcriptional activation. Further, B94 is shown to be a single copy gene that is evolutionarily conserved. The gene is localized to the q32 region of chromosome 14, a region that is often rearranged in lymphoid neoplasms. B94 transcript expression is also found to be regulated during mouse development and in an in vitro model of endothelial capillary tube formation. Developmental regulation occurs most prominently in mouse embryonic liver and kidney, and a second smaller form of B94 transcript is detected in the placenta and testes. B94 and other TNF-responsive transcripts are also induced during capillary tube formation suggesting overlap between genes induced by TNF and those induced during angiogenesis. Sequence analysis of the B94 cDNA reveals an open reading frame encoding a 73-kDa polypeptide that has no homology to any known protein. Polyclonal antisera directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of the B94 protein immunoprecipitates a protein of the predicted molecular mass both from COS cells transfected with a B94 expression vector and from TNF-treated HUVE cells.

1378843|t|Cloning and expression of a cell surface receptor for advanced glycosylation end products of proteins.
1378843|a|Advanced glycosylation end products of proteins (AGEs) are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins which accumulate in vascular tissue in aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes. A approximately 35-kDa polypeptide with a unique NH2-terminal sequence has been isolated from bovine lung and found to be present on the surface of endothelial cells where it mediates the binding of AGEs (receptor for advanced glycosylation end product or RAGE). Using an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino-terminal sequence of RAGE, an apparently full-length cDNA of 1.5 kilobases was isolated from a bovine lung cDNA library. This cDNA encoded a 394 amino acid mature protein comprised of the following putative domains: an extracellular domain of 332 amino acids, a single hydrophobic membrane spanning domain of 19 amino acids, and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 43 amino acids. A partial clone encoding the human counterpart of RAGE, isolated from a human lung library, was found to be approximately 90% homologous to the bovine molecule. Based on computer analysis of the amino acid sequence of RAGE and comparison with databases, RAGE is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules and shares significant homology with MUC 18, NCAM, and the cytoplasmic domain of CD20. Expression of the RAGE cDNA in 293 cells allowed them to bind 125I-AGE-albumin in a saturable and dose-dependent manner (Kd approximately 100 nM), blocked by antibody to RAGE. Western blots of 293 cells transfected with RAGE cDNA probed with anti-RAGE IgG demonstrated expression of immunoreactive protein compared to its absence in mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that RAGE functions as a cell surface receptor for AGEs, which could potentially mediate cellular effects of this class of glycosylated proteins.

1381503|t|Structure of the CD59-encoding gene: further evidence of a relationship to murine lymphocyte antigen Ly-6 protein.
1381503|a|The gene for CD59 [membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL), protectin], a phosphatidylinositol-linked surface glycoprotein that regulates the formation of the polymeric C9 complex of complement and that is deficient on the abnormal hematopoietic cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, consists of four exons spanning 20 kilobases. The untranslated first exon is preceded by a G+C-rich promoter region that lacks a consensus TATA or CAAT motif. The second exon encodes the hydrophobic leader sequence of the protein, and the third exon encodes the amino-terminal portion of the mature protein. The fourth exon encodes the remainder of the mature protein, including the hydrophobic sequence necessary for glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The structure of the CD59 gene is very similar to that encoding Ly-6, a murine glycoprotein with which CD59 has some structural similarity. The striking similarity in gene structure is further evidence that the two proteins belong to a superfamily of proteins that may also include the urokinase plasminogen-activator receptor and a squid glycoprotein of unknown function.

1505028|t|A tissue-specific MAR/SAR DNA-binding protein with unusual binding site recognition.
1505028|a|A human cDNA was cloned that encodes a DNA-binding protein (SATB1) that is expressed predominantly in thymus and binds selectively to the nuclear matrix/scaffold-associating DNAs (MARs/SARs). Missing nucleoside experiments showed that SATB1 selectively binds in a special AT-rich sequence context where one strand consists of mixed A's, T's, and C's, excluding G's (ATC sequences). When this feature is destroyed by mutation, SATB1 binding is greatly reduced even if the direct contact sequence remains intact. Conjunctional SATB1-binding sequences become stably unpaired in supercoiled DNA. Specific mutations that diminish the unwinding potential greatly reduce SATB1 binding. However, SATB1 does not bind single-stranded DNA. Chemical interference assays show that SATB1 binds along the minor groove with very little contact with the bases. This suggests that SATB1 recognizes the ATC sequence indirectly through the altered sugar-phosphate backbone structure present in the double-stranded DNA.

1567413|t|Cloning and characterization of a human angiotensin II type 1 receptor.
1567413|a|A human liver cDNA library was screened using a rat type 1 angiotensin II receptor cDNA coding sequence as a probe. cDNA clones were isolated which encoded a protein of 359 amino acids that shared 94.4% and 95.3% identify to rat and bovine type 1 angiotensin II receptors, respectively. Ligand binding studies of the cloned receptor expressed in COS cells suggested that it is pharmacologically a type 1 angiotensin II receptor subtype. Electrophysiological studies of the receptor expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that it could functionally couple to a second messenger system leading to the mobilization of intracellular stores of calcium. Southern and Northern blot analyses indicated that the cloned receptor is represented as a single copy in the human genome and is expressed in many tissues of different histogenic origin with the exception of brain, where mRNA transcripts were barely detectable.

Unlike ME31B, however, the new gene expresses an abundant transcript in a large number of adult tissues and its 5' non-coding region was found split in a t(11;14)(q23.3;q32.3) cell line from a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

1628620|t|Mutually exclusive expression of a helix-loop-helix gene and N-myc in human neuroblastomas and in normal development.
1628620|a|We have isolated a novel human gene encoding a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein by molecularly cloning chromosome 1p36-specific CpG islands. The gene termed heir-1 was localized to the neuroblastoma consensus deletion at 1p36.2-p36.12. Its predicted protein is 95.8% identical to the mouse HLH462 protein and has clear homology to the mouse Id and Drosophila emc proteins. Heir-1 does not encode a basic DNA binding domain as found in basic HLH proteins. The gene is expressed specifically at high abundance in adult lung, kidney and adrenal medulla, but not in adult brain. Despite prominent heir-1 expression in adrenal medulla, which is a prime target for neuroblastomas, 10 out of 12 neuroblastoma-derived cell lines revealed very low levels of heir-1 mRNA. Low heir-1 expression was generally found in tumor cell lines with N-myc overexpression, whereas the two cell lines displaying high heir-1 levels did not overexpress N-myc. Mutually exclusive expression of both genes was also found by in situ hybridization in developing mouse tissues, particularly in the forebrain neuroectoderm. We conclude that heir-1 expression is reduced specifically in the majority of neuroblastomas and suggest an inverse correlation between heir-1 and N-myc expression in neuroblastoma tumors and in embryonic development.

1648233|t|Identification, cloning, and expression of a cytosolic megakaryocyte protein-tyrosine-phosphatase with sequence homology to cytoskeletal protein 4.1.
1648233|a|We have isolated a cDNA encoding a third type of protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. We screened human megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01) an umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA libraries to obtain a 3.7-kilobase cDNA designated PTPase MEG. Northern blot analysis of MEG-01 RNA detected a 3.7-kilobase transcript, suggesting that a full-length cDNA has been identified. PTPase MEG cDNA contains an open reading frame of 926 amino acids. The cDNA has a G+C-rich 5' untranslated region of 771 nucleotides that has the potential to form stable stem-loop structures and has two upstream ATG codons. The predicted protein (Mr = 105,910) has no apparent membrane-spanning region and contains a single protein-tyrosine-phosphatase domain (amino acids 659-909) that is 35-40% identical to previously described tyrosine-phosphatase domains. The recombinant phosphatase domain possesses protein-tyrosine-phosphatase activity when expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino-terminal region (amino acids 31-367) is 45% identical to the amino terminus of human erythrocyte protein 4.1, a cytoskeletal protein. The identification of a protein-tyrosine-phosphatase that is related to cytoskeletal proteins implies that cell signaling activities reside not only in transmembrane receptors but in cytoskeletal elements as well.

1655529|t|Cloning, expression and chromosomal localization of a new putative receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase.
1655529|a|We have isolated a mouse cDNA of 5.7 kb, encoding a new member of the family of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases, termed mRPTP mu. The cDNA predicts a protein of 1432 amino acids (not including signal peptide) with a calculated Mr of 161,636. In addition, we have cloned the human homologue, hRPTP mu, which shows 98.7% amino acid identity to mRPTP mu. The predicted mRPTP mu protein consists of a 722 amino acid extracellular region, containing 13 potential N-glycosylation sites, a single transmembrane domain and a 688 amino acid intracellular part containing 2 tandem repeats homologous to the catalytic domains of other tyrosine phosphatases. The N-terminal extracellular part contains a region of about 170 amino acids with no sequence similarities to known proteins, followed by one Ig-like domain and 4 fibronectin type III-like domains. The intracellular part is unique in that the region between the transmembrane domain and the first catalytic domain is about twice as large as in other receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases. RNA blot analysis reveals a single transcript, that is most abundant in lung and present in much lower amounts in brain and heart. Transfection of the mRPTP mu cDNA into COS cells results in the synthesis of a protein with an apparent Mr of 195,000, as detected in immunoblots using an antipeptide antibody. The human RPTP mu gene is localized on chromosome 18pter-q11, a region with frequent abnormalities implicated in human cancer.

1693656|t|Structure, expression, and genetic linkage of the mouse BCM1 (OX45 or Blast-1) antigen. Evidence for genetic duplication giving rise to the BCM1 region on mouse chromosome 1 and the CD2/LFA3 region on mouse chromosome 3.
1693656|a|The mouse BCM1 (OX45, Blast-1) antigen has been cDNA cloned and sequenced to provide data supporting the view that BCM1, LFA3, and CD2 constitute a subgroup within the Ig superfamily. Mouse BCM1 is widely expressed on leukocytes and is likely to be anchored to the cell surface by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor, as is the case for rat and human BCM1 antigen. Genetic linkage studies by recombination and pulse field analysis showed the BCM1 locus (Bcm-1) to be on distal mouse chromosome 1 and to be linked within 1,600 kb to the locus for an ATPase alpha chain gene (Atpa-3). A similar relationship was established between the human BCM1 locus (BCM1) and ATP1A2, and other markers on chromosome 1q. Conservation of genomic organization within a segment of human chromosome 1q and mouse chromosome 1 was demonstrated. A similar situation is seen in the region of the CD2 and LFA3 genes between mouse chromosome 3 and human chromosome 1p. Furthermore, the CD2/LFA3 genes are linked within 580 kb to Atpa-1/ATP1A1 genes to provide a parallel situation to the linkage between Bcm-1/BCM1 and Atpa-3/ATP1A2 on chromosomes 1 (mouse) and 1q (human). Taken together, the data suggest duplication of a chromosome region including the precursors of the genes for BCM1, CD2, and LFA3, and the ATPase genes to give rise to the linkage groups now observed. The duplicated regions may have stayed together on chromosome 1 in the human (with the insertion of a centromere), while in the mouse, the genetic regions are proposed to have become dispersed in the formation of chromosomes 1 and 3. CD2 and LFA3 are more dissimilar in sequence than BCM1 and LFA3, and if the precursors of the CD2 and LFA3 loci formed before the proposed chromosome segment duplication, then a gene encoding a recognizer molecule for BCM1 may exist in linkage with Bcm-1/BCM1 on chromosome 1 (mouse) and 1q (human).

1698610|t|Soluble forms of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNF-Rs). The cDNA for the type I TNF-R, cloned using amino acid sequence data of its soluble form, encodes both the cell surface and a soluble form of the receptor.
1698610|a|Two proteins which specifically bind tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have recently been isolated from human urine in our laboratory. The two proteins cross-react immunologically with two species of cell surface TNF receptors (TNF-R). Antibodies against one of the two TNF binding proteins (TBPI) were found to have effects characteristic of TNF, including stimulating phosphorylation of specific cellular proteins. Oligonucleotide probes designed on the basis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of TBPI were used to clone the cDNA for the structurally related cell surface type 1 TNF-R. It is notable that although this receptor can signal the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, it appears from its amino acid sequence to be devoid of intrinsic protein kinase activity. The extracellular domain of the receptor is composed of four internal cysteine-rich repeats, homologous to structures repeated four times in the extracellular domains of the nerve growth factor receptor and the B lymphocytes surface antigen CDw40. The amino acid composition and size of the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R closely resemble those of TBPI. The COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of the four cysteine rich repeats within the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R matches the COOH-terminal sequence of TBPI. Amino acid sequences in the extracellular domain also fully match other sequences found in TBPI. On the other hand, amino acid sequences in the soluble form of the type II TNF-R (TBPII), while indicating a marked homology of structure, did not suggest any identity between this protein and the extracellular domain of the type I TNF-R. CHO cells transfected with type I TNF-R cDNA produced both cell surface and soluble forms of the receptor. The receptor produced by CHO cells was recognized by several monoclonal antibodies against TBPI, reacting with several distinct epitopes in this molecule. These data suggest that the soluble forms of the TNF-Rs are structurally identical to the extracellular cytokine binding domains of these receptors and are consistent with the notion that the soluble forms are, at least partly, derived from the same transcripts that encode the cell surface receptors.

1731328|t|Cloning and antisense oligodeoxynucleotide inhibition of a human homolog of cdc2 required in hematopoiesis.
1731328|a|Mechanisms triggering the commitment of pluripotent bone marrow stem cells to differentiated lineages such as mononuclear macrophages or multinucleated megakaryocytes are still unknown, although several lines of evidence suggested correlation between cholinergic signaling and hematopoietic differentiation. We now present cloning of a cDNA coding for CHED (cholinesterase-related cell division controller), a human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell division cycle 2 (cdc2)-like kinases, universal controllers of the mitotic cell cycle. Library screening, RNA blot hybridization, and direct PCR amplification of cDNA reverse-transcribed from cellular mRNA revealed that CHED mRNA is expressed in multiple tissues, including bone marrow. The CHED protein includes the consensus ATP binding and phosphorylation domains characteristic of kinases, displays 34-42% identically aligned amino acid residues with other cdc2-related kinases, and is considerably longer at its amino and carboxyl termini. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to interrupt CHED's expression (AS-CHED) significantly reduced the ratio between CHED mRNA and actin mRNA within 1 hr of its addition to cultures, a reduction that persisted for 4 days. AS-CHED treatment selectively inhibited megakaryocyte development in murine bone marrow cultures but did not prevent other hematopoietic pathways, as evidenced by increasing numbers of mononuclear cells. An oligodeoxynucleotide blocking production of the acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase, displayed a similar inhibition of megakaryocytopoiesis. In contrast, an oligodeoxynucleotide blocking production of the human 2Hs cdc2 homolog interfered with production of the human 2Hs cdc2 homolog interfered with cellular proliferation without altering the cell-type composition of these cultures. Therefore, these findings strengthen the link between cholinergic signaling and cell division control in hematopoiesis and implicate both CHED and cholinesterases in this differentiation process.

1770008|t|Structural analysis and expression of human desmoglein: a cadherin-like component of the desmosome.
1770008|a|Desmosomes are adhesive cell junctions found in great abundance in tissues that experience mechanical stress. The transmembrane desmosomal glycoproteins have been proposed to play a role in cell adhesion; desmoglein I (DGI) is a major member of this class of desmosomal molecules. However, evidence supporting a role for DGI in cell adhesion or in the plaque is lacking. In order to begin to understand DGI function we have identified human cDNA clones encoding the entire mature polypeptide of 1000 amino acids. Our data suggest that like the bovine DGI molecule human DGI is highly related to the calcium-dependent class of cell adhesion molecules known as cadherins. Four related extracellular domains located in the amino-terminal domain of the molecule contain putative calcium binding sites originally identified in the cadherins. The highest degree of similarity between human N-cadherin and human DGI, and likewise between bovine DGI and human DGI, is greatest in the most amino-terminal extracellular domain. This suggests a conserved functional role for the extracellular domains, perhaps in calcium-mediated cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic portion of the molecule contains a cadherin-like region and, like bovine DGI, a carboxy-terminal tail that is not present in the cadherins, comprising three additional domains. One of these contains a novel repeating motif of 29 +/- 1 residues, first identified in bovine DGI. Each of the highly homologous repeating units is likely to consist of two beta-strands and two turns with special characteristics. Five amino acids that are identical in bovine and human DGI lie in the second of the two predicted beta-strands, and intriguingly contain putative target sites for protein kinase C. On the basis of structural analysis, a model predicting the disposition of human DGI domains in the desmosome is proposed. Northern analysis suggests that unlike bovine epidermis, which expresses a single mRNA of reported size approximately 7.6 kb, human foreskin and cultured keratinocytes display a complex pattern with bands of approximately 7.2, 4.0 and 3.0 kb. Each of these cross-hybridizing mRNAs is coordinately expressed in normal human keratinocytes in response to long-term culture and increased calcium.

2007607|t|Characterization of human loricrin. Structure and function of a new class of epidermal cell envelope proteins.
2007607|a|We have isolated and characterized a full-length cDNA clone encoding human loricrin. Curiously, this protein displays major differences from the recently described mouse loricrin (Mehrel, T., Hohl, D., Nakazawa, H., Rothnagel, J.A., Longley, M.A., Bundman, D., Cheng, C.K., Lichti, U., Bisher, M.E., Steven, A. C., Steinert, P.M., Yuspa, S.H., and Roop, D.R. (1990) Cell 61, 1103-1112). Although both proteins are glycine-serine-cysteine-rich, the sequences have not been conserved. However, analysis of the sequences reveals a common motif of quasi-peptide repeats of an aliphatic or aromatic amino acid residue followed by several glycine and/or serine and cysteine residues. These sequences are interspersed and flanked by short glutamine- or glutamine/lysine-rich peptides. Thus loricrins consist of a family of cell envelope proteins of highly variable sequences that nevertheless retain common structural elements. We show that unlike all other putative protein components of the cell envelope, loricrins are highly insoluble, due at least in part to cross-linking by disulfide bonds. Furthermore, we have isolated four peptides from purified human cell envelopes that contain recognizable loricrin sequences and which are cross-linked by the N epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide bond. The presence of such bonds thus affords an explanation for the extraordinary insolubility of loricrin by cross-linking to the cell envelope and can also explain the low steady-state levels of monomeric loricrin in cytoskeletal extracts of epidermis. This study represents the first report of this isodipeptide cross-link in a protein component of the cornified cell envelope. We propose a model for the structure of loricrin in which (i) the unusual glycine-serine-rich sequences adopt a flexible loop conformation, indexed on the recurrent aliphatic residues; (ii) inter- or intramolecular isodipeptide and disulfide cross-links induce or stabilize folding of loricrin so as to form a more compact rosette-like structure; and (iii) the presence of the flexible glycine-rich loops necessarily will impact a flexible character to the cell envelope and entire epithelium.

2115402|t|Localization of low molecular weight GTP binding proteins to exocytic and endocytic compartments.
2115402|a|A set of 11 clones encoding putative GTP binding proteins highly homologous to the yeast YPT1/SEC4 gene products have been isolated from an MDCK cell cDNA library. We localized three of the corresponding proteins in mammalian cells by using affinity-purified antibodies in immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies. One, the MDCK homolog of rab2, is associated with a structure having the characteristics of an intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The second, rab5, is located at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and on early endosomes, while the third, rab7, is found on late endosomes. These findings provide evidence that members of the YPT1/SEC4 subfamily of GTP binding proteins are localized to specific exocytic and endocytic subcompartments in mammalian cells.

2172835|t|A human homologue of the yeast HDEL receptor.
2172835|a|Retention of resident proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is achieved in both yeast and animal cells by their continual retrieval from the cis-Golgi, or a pre-Golgi compartment. Sorting of these proteins is dependent on a C-terminal tetrapeptide signal, usually Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL in the single letter code) in animal cells, His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There is evidence that the ERD2 gene encodes the sorting receptor that recognizes HDEL in yeast; its product is an integral membrane protein of relative molecular mass 26,000 (26K) that is not glycosylated. In contrast, Vaux et al. suggest that the mammalian KDEL receptor is a 72K glycoprotein that they detected using an anti-idiotypic antibody approach. If this were so, it would indicate a surprising divergence of the retrieval machinery between yeast and animal cells. We report here that human cells express a protein similar in sequence, size and properties to the ERD2 product, and propose that this protein is the human KDEL receptor.

2208279|t|Primary structure and functional expression of rat and human stem cell factor DNAs.
2208279|a|Partial cDNA and genomic clones of rat stem cell factor (SCF) have been isolated. Using probes based on the rat sequence, partial and full-length cDNA and genomic clones of human SCF have been isolated. Based on the primary structure of the 164 amino acid protein purified from BRL-3A cells, truncated forms of the rat and human proteins have been expressed in E. coli and mammalian cells and have been shown to possess biological activity. SCF is able to augment the proliferation of both myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic progenitors in bone marrow cultures. SCF exhibits potent synergistic activities in conjunction with colony-stimulating factors, resulting in increased colony numbers and colony size.

2260980|t|Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA encoding human ferrochelatase.
2260980|a|The cDNA encoding human ferrochelatase [EC 4.99.1.1] was isolated from a human placenta cDNA library in bacteriophage lambda gt11 by screening with a radiolabeled fragment of mouse ferrochelatase cDNA. The cDNA had an open reading frame of 1269 base pairs (bp) encoding a protein of 423 amino acid residues (Mr. 47,833) with alternative putative polyadenylation signals in the 3' non-coding regions and poly (A) tails. Amino acid sequencing showed that the mature protein consists of 369 amino acid residues (Mr. 42,158) with a putative leader sequence of 54 amino acid residues. The human enzyme showed an 88% identity to mouse enzyme and 46% to yeast enzyme. Northern blot analysis showed two mRNAs of about 2500 and 1600 bp for ferrochelatase in K562 and HepG2 cells. As full-length cDNA for human ferrochelatase is now available, molecular lesions related to erythropoietic protoporphyria can be characterized.

2265692|t|Sequence identity between human pancreatic cholesterol esterase and bile salt-stimulated milk lipase.
2265692|a|Three overlapping cDNA clones covering the entire primary sequence of the bile salt stimulated lipase in human milk were isolated from a human breast lambda gt10 cDNA library by screening with the rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase cDNA. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA showed that the human milk lipase mRNA encodes a 748-residue protein, including a 23-residue signal peptide. The human milk lipase cDNA is highly homologous to rat pancreatic cholesterol esterase, suggesting that the milk lipase may be identical to the cholesterol esterase in human pancreas. This conclusion was confirmed by isolation and sequencing of the cDNA for human pancreatic cholesterol esterase. Analysis of the sequence for the human cholesterol esterase/milk lipase revealed similarities to other serine esterases in three distinct regions of the protein. These domains may represent the active site triads of these proteins.

2365818|t|Maple syrup urine disease. Complete primary structure of the E1 beta subunit of human branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex deduced from the nucleotide sequence and a gene analysis of patients with this disease.
2365818|a|A defect in the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex is one cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of MSUD, we isolated and characterized a 1.35 kbp cDNA clone encoding the entire precursor of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH complex from a human placental cDNA library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the isolated cDNA clone (lambda hBE1 beta-1) contained a 5'-untranslated sequence of four nucleotides, the translated sequence of 1,176 nucleotides and the 3'-untranslated sequence of 169 nucleotides. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert of the clone with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mature bovine BCKDH-E1 beta subunit showed that the cDNA insert encodes for a 342-amino acid subunit with a Mr = 37,585. The subunit is synthesized as the precursor with a leader sequence of 50 amino acids and is processed at the NH2 terminus. A search for protein homology revealed that the primary structure of human BCKDH-E1 beta was similar to the bovine BCKDH-E1 beta and to the E1 beta subunit of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, in all regions. The structures and functions of mammalian alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes are apparently highly conserved. Genomic DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal and five MSUD patients, in whom E1 beta was not detected by immunoblot analysis, gave the same restriction maps on Southern blot analysis. The gene has at least 80 kbp.

2415537|t|Sequence and expression of a human type II mesothelial keratin.
2415537|a|Using mRNA from cultured human mesothelial cells, we constructed bacterial plasmids and lambda phage vectors that contained cDNA sequences specific for the keratins expressed in these cells. A cloned cDNA encoding keratin K7 (55 kD) was identified by positive hybrid selection. Southern Blot analysis indicated that this sequence is represented only once in the human genome, and Northern Blot analysis demonstrated that the gene encoding K7 is expressed in abundance in cultured bronchial and mesothelial cells, but only weakly in cultured epidermal cells and not at all in liver, colon, or exocervical tissue. The predicted amino acid sequence of this keratin has revealed a striking difference between this keratin and the type II keratins expressed in epidermal cells: whereas all of the epidermal type II keratins thus far sequenced have long nonhelical termini rich in glycine and serine, this mesothelial type II keratin has amino and carboxy terminal regions that are unusually short and lack the inexact repeats of glycine and serine residues.

2558868|t|Isolation and sequence of a cDNA clone for human calcineurin B, the Ca2+-binding subunit of the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase.
2558868|a|We have identified and cloned human cDNA for the Ca2+-binding subunit of calcineurin, the brain isozyme of the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated protein phosphatase. The 2.5-kb cDNA has an open reading frame of 510 bp, a leader sequence of at least 500 bp, and a 1,277-bp 3'-noncoding sequence. The deduced sequence of the human protein differs from bovine brain calcineurin B by an additional valine at the carboxyl terminus and substitution of Met-11 and Ser-153 by cysteine. A partial clone of the mouse protein corresponding to amino acids 75-150 was also isolated. This portion of the human and mouse protein sequence is identical, with the DNA sequences showing 94% identity. The respective mRNAs in human and mouse are also of similar size. As was observed with protein levels, mRNA abundance in brain is 20-60 times that found in other tissues with the exception of HeLa cells which, like brain, contain abundant calcineurin B mRNA.

2674117|t|Human liver serine dehydratase. cDNA cloning and sequence homology with hydroxyamino acid dehydratases from other sources.
2674117|a|Rat liver serine dehydratase cDNA was used to screen a human liver cDNA library in lambda gt11. One positive clone occurred in every 5,000 clones. Fifteen positive clones were plaque purified. The largest cDNA obtained contained an open reading frame of 987 base pairs, and 5' and 3' noncoding regions of 89 and 317 base pairs, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence, with a calculated Mr of 34,615, was similar to that of rat liver serine dehydratase except for the absence of a segment consisting of 36 amino acid residues. In vitro transcription/translation with the cDNA resulted in the formation of a polypeptide with an Mr of approximately 35,000, which cross-reacted with the anti-rat serine dehydratase antibody. These results suggest that the human serine dehydratase is structurally cognate with the rat enzyme. Moreover, portions of the sequence postulated to be essential for activity in microbial threonine dehydratases are found in the mammalian serine dehydratases, suggesting that hydroxyamino and dehydratases may have originated from a common ancestor.

2674141|t|Human gastric cathepsin E. Predicted sequence, localization to chromosome 1, and sequence homology with other aspartic proteinases.
2674141|a|The predicted sequence of human gastric cathepsin E (CTSE) was determined by analysis of cDNA clones isolated from a library constructed with poly(A+) RNA from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. The CTSE cDNA clones were identified using a set of complementary 18-base oligonucleotide probes specific for a 6-residue sequence surrounding the first active site of all previously characterized human aspartic proteinases. Sequence analysis of CTSE cDNA clones revealed a 1188-base pair open reading frame that exhibited 59% sequence identity with human pepsinogen A. The predicted CTSE amino acid sequence includes a 379-residue proenzyme (Mr = 40,883) and a 17-residue signal peptide. The predicted CTSE amino acid composition was consistent with that of purified material from gastric mucosa and gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. Additional evidence for the identification of the CTSE cDNA clones was obtained by analysis of poly(A+) RNA isolated from CTSE-producing and -nonproducing gastric adenocarcinoma cell subclones. Three RNA transcripts (3.6, 2.6, and 2.1 kilobases) were identified in poly(A+) RNA isolated from a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line that produced CTSE that were absent from nonproducing subclones. CTSE contains 7 cysteine residues, of which 6 were localized by comparative maximal alignment analysis with pepsinogen A to conserved residues that form intrachain disulfide bonds. The seventh cysteine residue of CTSE is located within the activation peptide region of the proenzyme. We suspect that this residue forms an interchain disulfide bond and thereby determines the dimerization of CTSE proenzyme molecules that is observed under native conditions. The CTSE gene was localized to human chromosome 1 by concurrent cytogenetic and cDNA probe analyses of a panel of human x mouse somatic cell hybrids.

2739739|t|COUP transcription factor is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily.
2739739|a|The COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor (COUP-TF) exists in a number of different tissues and is essential for expression of the chicken ovalbumin gene. It binds to the ovalbumin promoter and, in conjunction with a second protein (S300-II), stimulates initiation of transcription in vitro. COUP-TF also binds specifically to the rat insulin promoter element, although the two binding sites share little sequence similarity. Here we report the isolation of a human complementary DNA clone encoding COUP-TF. Comparison of the amino-acid sequence of COUP-TF with known sequences reveals that it is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone/vitamin receptor superfamily. Consequently, it is the first member of this family that has been shown to function in a cell-free transcription system. We conclude that this superfamily of gene regulators contains proteins which bind and activate distal promoter elements of eukaryotic genes.

2786251|t|Autoimmune target in Heymann nephritis is a glycoprotein with homology to the LDL receptor.
2786251|a|The pathogenesis of Heymann nephritis, a rat model of human membranous glomerulonephritis, depends on the interaction of autoantibodies with a renal glycoprotein (GP330) on glomerular podocytes. Partial complementary DNAs coding for GP330 were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence from 4.3 kilobases of complementary DNA contains the sequences identical to two peptides derived from the isolated glycoprotein. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein contains regions with homology to the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, an indication that GP330 and the LDL receptor may be members of the same gene family. Autoantibodies from the kidneys of rats with Heymann nephritis reacted with a nonglycosylated segment of GP330 that contains cysteine-rich 40-amino acid repeats, which are also features of the LDL receptor. GP330 is also similar in some regions to the mouse epidermal growth factor precursor.

2885805|t|Human mRNA polyadenylate binding protein: evolutionary conservation of a nucleic acid binding motif.
2885805|a|We have isolated a full length cDNA (cDNA) coding for the human poly(A) binding protein. The cDNA derived 73 kd basic translation product has the same Mr, isoelectric point and peptidic map as the poly(A) binding protein. DNA sequence analysis reveals a 70,244 dalton protein. The N terminal part, highly homologous to the yeast poly(A) binding protein, is sufficient for poly(A) binding activity. This domain consists of a four-fold repeated unit of approximately 80 amino acids present in other nucleic acid binding proteins. In the C terminal part there is, as in the yeast protein, a sequence of approximately 150 amino acids, rich in proline, alanine and glutamine which together account for 48% of the residues. A 2,9 kb mRNA corresponding to this cDNA has been detected in several vertebrate cell types and in Drosophila melanogaster at every developmental stage including oogenesis.

3014652|t|Studies of the human c-myb gene and its product in human acute leukemias.
3014652|a|The myb gene is the transforming oncogene of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV); its normal cellular homolog, c-myb, is conserved across a broad span of evolution. In humans, c-myb is expressed in malignant hematopoietic cell lines and in primary hematopoietic tumors. Partial complementary DNA clones were generated from blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The sequences of the clones were compared to the c-myb of other species, as well as the v-myb of AMV. In addition, the carboxyl terminal region of human c-myb was placed in an expression vector to obtain protein for the generation of antiserum, which was used to identify the human c-myb gene product. Like v-myb, this protein was found within the nucleus of leukemic cells where it was associated with the nuclear matrix. These studies provide further evidence that c-myb might be involved in human leukemia.

3202857|t|Molecular cloning and primary structure of human 15-lipoxygenase.
3202857|a|A full-length cDNA encoding 15-lipoxygenase has been isolated from a human reticulocyte cDNA library. The predicted primary structure of the enzyme exhibits a sequence similarity of 61% and 45% with human 5-lipoxygenase and the soybean lipoxygenase isoenzyme I, respectively. When all three lipoxygenases are aligned, there are two distinct regions of significant sequence identity including a cluster of five histidine residues conserved in all three lipoxygenases. Because histidines can serve as ligands for the enzymatically active iron, this region may be critical to enzymatic function. These results provide a basis for exploring functional domains of lipoxygenases.

3203386|t|Isolation and properties of cDNA clones encoding SRF, a transcription factor that binds to the c-fos serum response element.
3203386|a|The serum response element (SRE) is a sequence required for transient transcriptional activation of genes in response to growth factors. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous nuclear protein that binds to the SRE. The SRF gene is highly conserved through evolution, and in cultured cells its transcription is itself transiently increased following serum stimulation. A cDNA clone of SRF expressed in vitro generates protein that forms complexes indistinguishable from those formed with HeLa cell SRF, as judged by DNA binding specificity and the ability to promote SRE-dependent in vitro transcription. SRF binds DNA as a dimer, and the DNA binding/dimerization domain of the protein exhibits striking homology to two yeast regulatory proteins.

3446585|t|Isolation of cDNA clones coding for rat isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase and assignment of the gene to human chromosome 15.
3446585|a|Rat liver mRNA encoding the cytoplasmic precursor of mitochondrial isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase was highly enriched by polysome immunopurification using a polyclonal monospecific antibody. The purified mRNA was used to prepare a plasmid cDNA library which was screened with two oligonucleotide mixtures encoding two peptides in the amino-terminal portion of mature rat isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase. Thirty-one overlapping cDNA clones, spanning a region of 2.1 kbp, were isolated and characterized. The cDNA sequence of a 5'-end clone, rIVD-13 (155 bp), predicts a mitochondrial leader peptide of 30 amino acid residues and the first 18 amino acids of the mature protein. These consecutive 18 residues completely matched the amino-terminal peptide determined by automated Edman degradation of the rat enzyme. The leader peptide contains six arginines, has no acidic residues, and is particularly rich in leucine, alanine, and proline residues. Southern blot analysis of DNAs from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids with an isolated rat cDNA (2 kbp) assigned the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene to the long arm of chromosome 15, region q14----qter. The chromosomal assignment was confirmed and further refined to bands q14----q15 by in situ hybridization of the probe to human metaphase cells. This location differs from that of the gene for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a closely related enzyme, which has been previously assigned to chromosome 1.

3758678|a|A cDNA encoding human delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D; EC 4.2.1.24), the second enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, was isolated from a human liver cDNA expression library. Of the original 17 clones selected with anti-ALA-D antibody, only four expressed anti-ALA-D epitopes as assessed by rescreening with antibody preabsorbed with purified antigen. Subsequent screening of the antibody-positive clones with mixed oligodeoxynucleotide (oligo) probes, synthesized to correspond to human N-terminal and bovine active-site peptide sequences, identified three clones which hybridized only with the oligo probes for the bovine amino acid (aa) sequences. Restriction endonucleases analysis revealed that these three clones contained the same 800-bp cDNA insert. This insert was recloned into bacteriophage M13mp18 and mp19 and sequenced by primer extension. The aa sequence predicted from the partial nucleotide sequence was found to be essentially colinear with the sequences of four bovine ALA-D peptides, totaling 35 non-overlapping aa residues.

6688123|t|Human beta-nerve growth factor gene sequence highly homologous to that of mouse.
6688123|a|Nerve growth factor (NGF) is thought to have a profound effect on the development and maintenance of sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurones (see refs 1-3 for review). NGF activity isolated from the male mouse submaxillary gland (MSG) consists of three types of subunits, alpha, beta and gamma, which specifically interact to form a 7S, approximately 130,000-molecular weight (Mr) complex. The 7S complex contains two identical 118-amino acid beta-chains, which are solely responsible for the nerve growth-stimulating activity of NGF. While NGF is found in almost all vertebrates, most research has focused on murine NGF, as the mouse male submaxillary gland contains higher levels of this polypeptide than other tissues. Even so, beta-NGF comprises only approximately 0.1% of the protein in this small gland, which has made the study of this polypeptide difficult. The amino acid sequence of the mouse NGF beta-chain has been determined and some information has been obtained regarding the size of a mouse precursor molecule, pro-beta-NGF, but little was known about the structure and relatedness of beta-NGF from other vertebrates. Here we describe the isolation of mouse beta-NGF complementary DNA (cDNA) and present its nucleotide sequence, which predicts a prepro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 27,000 (27K) and a pro-beta-NGF molecule of Mr 25K. We have used the mouse beta-NGF cDNA clone to isolate the human beta-NGF gene, the coding regions of which are highly homologous to the mouse prepro-beta-NGF nucleotide and amino acid sequences.

7479798|t|Cloning and characterization of a cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene, the human homologue to the yeast chromosome segregation gene CSE1.
7479798|a|We recently isolated human cDNA fragments that render MCF-7 breast cancer cells resistant to cell death caused by Pseudomonas exotoxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin-derived immunotoxins, diphtheria toxin, and tumor necrosis factor. We report here that one of these fragments is an antisense fragment of a gene homologous to the essential yeast chromosome segregation gene CSE1. Cloning and analysis of the full-length cDNA of the human CSE1 homologue, which we name CAS for cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene, reveals a protein coding region with similar length (971 amino acids for CAS, 960 amino acids for CSE1) and 59% overall protein homology to the yeast CSE1 protein. The conservation of this gene indicates it has an important function in human cells consistent with the essential role of CSE1 in yeast. CAS is highly expressed in human tumor cell lines and in human testis and fetal liver, tissues that contain actively dividing cells. Furthermore, CAS expression increases when resting human fibroblasts are induced to proliferate and decreases when they are growth-arrested. Thus, CAS appears to play an important role in both toxin and tumor necrosis factor-mediated cell death, as well as in cell proliferation.

7490079|t|Molecular cloning of the human homolog of a striatum-enriched phosphatase (STEP) gene and chromosomal mapping of the human and murine loci.
7490079|a|A gene for a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library by PCR amplification. Sequence analysis revealed that the PTPase has a single phosphatase catalytic domain located at the C-terminus that includes the highly conserved amino acid domain [I/V]HCXAGXXR[S/T]GX[F/Y] found in all tyrosine phosphatases. Two proline-rich regions located at the N-terminus may contain putative Src homology domain 3 (SH3) binding motifs. Comparison of the PTPase with a previously cloned striatum enriched phosphatase (STEP) from rat and from mouse exhibited a high degree of identity (approximately 85-90%) at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels, indicating that the human PTPase is the homolog of the rat and murine STEP gene. By using a combination of somatic cell hybrid analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have mapped the human STEP locus to chromosome 11p15.2-p15.1 and the murine STEP gene to chromosome 7B3-B5. These are two regions of known conserved synteny, providing further evidence that the human STEP is a true homolog of the murine STEP gene. Candidate disease genes in the vicinity include Usher syndrome type 1C in human and a mouse mutant locus, twister (twt).

7490082|t|Cloning of the cDNA for the human ATP synthase OSCP subunit (ATP5O) by exon trapping and mapping to chromosome 21q22.1-q22.2.
7490082|a|Exon trapping was used to clone portions of potential genes from human chromosome 21. One trapped sequence showed striking homology with the bovine and rat ATP synthase OSCP (oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein) subunit. We subsequently cloned the full-length human ATP synthase OSCP cDNA (GDB/HGMW approved name ATP50) from infant brain and muscle libraries and determined its nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence (EMBL/GenBank Accession No. X83218). The encoded polypeptide contains 213 amino acids, with more than 80% identity to bovine and murine ATPase OSCP subunits and over 35% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and sweet potato sequences. The human ATP5O gene is located at 21q22.1-q22.2, just proximal to D21S17, in YACs 860G11 and 838C7 of the Chumakov et al. (Nature 359:380, 1992) YAC contig. The gene is expressed in all human tissues examined, most strongly in muscle and heart. This ATP5O subunit is a key structural component of the stalk of the mitochondrial respiratory chain F1F0-ATP synthase and as such may contribute in a gene dosage-dependent manner to the phenotype of Down syndrome (trisomy 21).

7490091|t|Generation of a transcription map at the HSD17B locus centromeric to BRCA1 at 17q21.
7490091|a|A detailed transcription map of the 320-kb region containing the HSD17B locus on chromosome 17 was generated. Thirty unique cDNA fragments, retrieved following the hybridization of immobilized YACs to primary pools of cDNAs prepared from RNA of mammary gland, ovary, placenta, and the Caco-2 cell line, were aligned into 10 transcription units by physical mapping and hybridization to RNAs of a series of tissues. The cDNAs were then further characterized by sequencing and used to screen mammary gland cDNA libraries. Fragments corresponding to the broadly expressed gamma-tubulin and Ki antigen genes were identified. A full-length cDNA clone encoding a 117-amino-acid protein homologous to the rat ribosomal protein L34 was isolated. Portions of genes with restricted patterns of expression were also obtained, including the previously characterized HSD17B1. One new gene, for which a full-length cDNA was isolated, was found to have an interesting tissue-specific pattern of expression with abundant mRNA in both the colon and the testis and in the mammary carcinoma cell line BT-474. This contrasted with the barely detectable level observed in several tissues including normal mammary gland. Of the five additional transcription units identified, one showed no similarity, two showed identity to human expressed sequences, and two displayed similarity to genes of animal species by amino acid alignment. These latter cDNA clones include potential homologues of a rat nuclear tyrosine phosphatase and of a factor of Drosophila that is known to be involved in the negative regulation of transcription of segment identity genes.

7509806|t|Human serum biotinidase. cDNA cloning, sequence, and characterization.
7509806|a|Biotinidase (EC 3.5.1.12) catalyzes the hydrolysis of biocytin, the product of biotin-dependent carboxylase degradation, to biotin and lysine. Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder of biotin recycling that is characterized by neurological and cutaneous abnormalities, and can be successfully treated with biotin supplementation. Sequences of tryptic peptides of the purified human serum enzyme were used to design oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification from human hepatic total RNA to generate putative biotinidase cDNA fragments. Sequence analysis of a cDNA isolated from a human liver library by plaque hybridization with the largest cDNA probe revealed an open reading frame of 1629 bases encoding a protein of 543 amino acid residues, including 41 amino acids of a potential signal peptide. Comparison of the open reading frame with the known biotinidase tryptic peptides and recognition of the expressed protein encoded by this cDNA by monoclonal antibodies prepared against purified biotinidase demonstrated the identity of this cDNA. Southern analyses suggested that biotinidase is a single copy gene and revealed that human cDNA probes hybridized to genomic DNA from mammals, but not from chicken or yeast. Northern analysis indicated the presence of biotinidase mRNA in human heart, brain, placenta, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas.

7512734|t|C3G, a guanine nucleotide-releasing protein expressed ubiquitously, binds to the Src homology 3 domains of CRK and GRB2/ASH proteins.
7512734|a|CRK protein, together with GRB2/ASH and Nck proteins, belongs to the adaptor-type Src homology (SH)2-containing molecules, which transduce signals from tyrosine kinases. Here another guanine nucleotide-releasing protein (GNRP), C3G, has been identified as a CRK SH3-binding protein. The nucleotide sequence of a 4.1-kb C3G cDNA contains a 3.2-kb open reading frame encoding a 121-kDa protein, and antibodies against C3G have been shown to detect a protein of 130-140 kDa. The carboxyl terminus of C3G has a peptide sequence homologous to GNRPs for Ras, and the expression of this carboxyl terminus region suppresses the loss of CDC25 function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The C3G protein expressed in Escherichia coli binds to CRK and GRB2/ASH proteins. Mutational analysis of C3G assigns the SH3 binding region to a 50-amino acid region containing a proline-rich sequence. The mRNAs of both the C3G and CRK proteins are expressed ubiquitously in human adult and fetal tissues. The results of these studies suggest that the complex of CRK and C3G, or GRB2/ASH and C3G, may transduce the signals from tyrosine kinases to Ras in a number of different tissues.

7513050|t|A novel mammalian protein, p55CDC, present in dividing cells is associated with protein kinase activity and has homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle proteins Cdc20 and Cdc4.
7513050|a|A novel protein, p55CDC, has been identified in cycling mammalian cells. This transcript is readily detectable in all exponentially growing cell lines but disappears when cells are chemically induced to fall out of the cell cycle and differentiate. The p55CDC protein appears to be essential for cell division, since transfection of antisense p55CDC cDNA into CHO cells resulted in isolation of only those cells which exhibited a compensatory increase in p55CDC transcripts in the sense orientation. Immunoprecipitation of p55CDC yielded protein complexes with kinase activity which fluctuated during the cell cycle. Since p55CDC does not have the conserved protein kinase domains, this activity must be due to one or more of the associated proteins in the immune complex. The highest levels of protein kinase activity were seen with alpha-casein and myelin basic protein as substrates and demonstrated a pattern of activity distinct from that described for the known cyclin-dependent cell division kinases. The p55CDC protein was also phosphorylated in dividing cells. The amino acid sequence of p55CDC contains seven repeats homologous to the beta subunit of G proteins, and the highest degree of homology in these repeats was found with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc20 and Cdc4 proteins, which have been proposed to be involved in the formation of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle in yeast cells. The G beta repeat has been postulated to mediate protein-protein interactions and, in p55CDC, may modulate its association with a unique cell cycle protein kinase. These findings suggest that p55CDC is a component of the mammalian cell cycle mechanism.

7520377|t|The immunoreactive region in a novel autoantigen contains a nuclear localization sequence.
7520377|a|Antibodies in the serum of patients with autoimmune diseases have been used to identify human autoantigens. Because autoantibodies often recognize active sites within corresponding protein antigens, autoantibodies have facilitated the functional characterization of these polypeptides. In the present study, serum from a patient with Sjögren's syndrome was used to identify a novel autoantigen which was designated Ge-1. Using the patient's serum, a 4.8-kb cDNA encoding Ge-1 was identified. Fragments of the cDNA were ligated into prokaryotic expression vectors, expressed in Escherichia coli, and used to produce recombinant Ge-1 fusion proteins. Fusion proteins containing different portions of Ge-1 were used to identify a 58 amino acid immunoreactive region within the protein. This immunoreactive region contained the protein's putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS). To demonstrate that the immunoreactive region was capable of functioning as a NLS, a eukaryotic expression plasmid was constructed to encode the immunoreactive region fused to the cytoplasmic protein, chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. After transfection of this plasmid into COS-1 cells, the fusion protein was detected in the nucleus. The presence of the NLS motif within the immunoreactive region of Ge-1 and other nuclear autoantigens suggests that the NLS may be a target of human autoantibodies.

7528931|t|Molecular characterization of an aquaporin cDNA from brain: candidate osmoreceptor and regulator of water balance.
7528931|a|The aquaporins transport water through membranes of numerous tissues, but the molecular mechanisms for sensing changes in extracellular osmolality and regulating water balance in brain are unknown. We have isolated a brain aquaporin by homology cloning. Like aquaporin 1 (AQP1, also known as CHIP, channel-forming integral membrane protein of 28 kDa), the deduced polypeptide has six putative transmembrane domains but lacks cysteines at the known mercury-sensitive sites. Two initiation sites were identified encoding polypeptides of 301 and 323 amino acids; expression of each in Xenopus oocytes conferred a 20-fold increase in osmotic water permeability not blocked by 1 mM HgCl2, even after substitution of cysteine at the predicted mercury-sensitive site. Northern analysis and RNase protection demonstrated the mRNA to be abundant in mature rat brain but only weakly detectable in eye, kidney, intestine, and lung. In situ hybridization of brain localized the mRNA to ependymal cells lining the aqueduct, glial cells forming the edge of the cerebral cortex and brainstem, vasopressin-secretory neurons in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamus, and Purkinje cells of cerebellum. Its distinctive expression pattern implicates this fourth mammalian member of the aquaporin water channel family (designated gene symbol, AQP4) as the osmoreceptor which regulates body water balance and mediates water flow within the central nervous system.

7536611|t|Functional expression and pharmacological characterization of the human EAA4 (GluR6) glutamate receptor: a kainate selective channel subunit.
7536611|a|A cDNA encoding an ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit protein humEAA4 (GluR6), has been cloned from a human fetal brain library. This cDNA when expressed in COS or HEK-293 cells is associated with high-affinity kainate receptor binding and ion channel formation. We have successfully established cell lines stably expressing humEAA4 in HEK-293 cells This is the first report of the establishment of stable cell lines expressing a glutamate receptor channel. The relative potency of compounds for displacing [3H]-kainate binding to humEAA4 receptors expressed in COS or HEK-293 cells is domoate > kainate > quisqualate > 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione > L-glutamate = 6,7- dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione > dihydrokainate. Applications of kainate, glutamate, and domoate but not AMPA evoked rapidly desensitizing currents in cells expressing homo-oligomeric humEAA4 in a concentration dependent manner. The order of potency was: domoate > kainate > L-glutamate. Although AMPA did not itself activate humEAA4 receptors it did reduce, to a limited extent, kainate-evoked responses. AMPA may therefore be a weak partial agonist for this receptor. To date this effect has not been demonstrated with rat GluR6. It is possible that subtle species differences may exist in the nature of agonist receptor interaction. Kainate evoked currents were attenuated by the quinoxalinediones CNQX and DNQX but not by DAP5. The receptor desensitization was attenuated on application of concanavalin A. Ion-permeability studies indicated that the receptor-linked ion channel is permeable to both Na+ and Ca2+ ions.

7556170|t|Expression of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors in human immune tissues and leukocyte subpopulations.
7556170|a|Two proteins with seven transmembrane-spanning domains typical of guanosine-nucleotide-binding-protein-coupled receptors have been identified as cannabinoid receptors; the central cannabinoid receptor, CB1, and the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, CB2, initially described in rat brain and spleen, respectively. Here, we report the distribution patterns for both CB1 and CB2 transcripts in human immune cells and in several human tissues, as analysed using a highly sensitive and quantitative PCR-based method. CB1 was mainly expressed in the central nervous system and, to a lower extent, in several peripheral tissues such as adrenal gland, heart, lung, prostate, uterus, ovary, testis, bone marrow, thymus and tonsils. In contrast, the CB2 gene, which is not expressed in the brain, was particularly abundant in immune tissues, with an expression level 10-100-fold higher than that of CB1. Although CB2 mRNA was also detected in some other peripheral tissues, its level remained very low. In spleen and tonsils, the CB2 mRNA content was equivalent to that of CB1 mRNA in the central nervous system. Among the main human blood cell subpopulations, the distribution pattern of the CB2 mRNA displayed important variations. The rank order of CB2 mRNA levels in these cells was B-cells > natural killer cells >> monocytes > polymorphonuclear neutrophil cells > T8 cells > T4 cells. The same rank order was also established in human cell lines belonging to the myeloid, monocytic and lymphoid lineages. The prevailing expression of the CB2 gene in immune tissues was confirmed by Northern-blot analysis. In addition, the expression of the CB2 protein was demonstrated by an immunohistological analysis performed on tonsil sections using specific anti-(human CB2) IgG; this experiment showed that CB2 expression was restricted to B-lymphocyte-enriched areas of the mantle of secondary lymphoid follicles. These results suggest that (a) CB1 and CB2 can be considered as tissue-selective antigens of the central nervous system and immune system, respectively, and (b) cannabinoids may exert specific receptor-mediated actions on the immune system through the CB2 receptor.

7556175|t|Molecular cloning and functional expression of the gene encoding the human proteinase-activated receptor 2.
7556175|a|We previously reported the molecular cloning of a mouse guanosine-nucleotide-binding-protein-coupled receptor similar to the thrombin receptor. Since the physiological agonist was unknown, the receptor was named proteinase-activated receptor 2. We describe here the cloning and functional expression of the gene encoding the corresponding human receptor. The gene is divided into two exons separated by about 14 kb intronic DNA. The deduced protein sequence is 397 amino acids long and 83% identical to the mouse receptor sequence. Within the extracellular amino terminus, the residues predicted to form the tethered agonist ligand differ between the two receptors; of the first six residues only four are conserved. At positions five and six, a lysine residue and a valine residue, respectively, have replaced arginine and leucine residues found in the mouse sequence. When the human receptor is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it can be activated by low nanomolar concentrations of the serine proteinase trypsin and by peptides made from the receptor sequence. Northern-blot analysis of receptor expression showed that the receptor transcript is widely expressed in human tissues with especially high levels in pancreas, liver, kidney, small intestine and colon. Moderate expression was detected in many organs but none in brain or skeletal muscle. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, the human proteinase-activated receptor 2 gene was mapped to chromosomal region 5q13, where, previously, the related thrombin receptor gene has been located.

7624774|t|Interaction of papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins with a putative calcium-binding protein.
7624774|a|Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with the majority of cervical cancers and encode a transforming protein, E6, that interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. Because E6 has p53-independent transforming activity, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for other E6-binding proteins. One such protein, E6BP, interacted with cancer-associated HPV E6 and with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E6. The transforming activity of BPV-1 E6 mutants correlated with their E6BP-binding ability. E6BP is identical to a putative calcium-binding protein, ERC-55, that appears to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.

7624799|t|Cloning and characterization of a G protein-activated human phosphoinositide-3 kinase.
7624799|a|Phosphoinositide-3 kinase activity is implicated in diverse cellular responses triggered by mammalian cell surface receptors and in the regulation of protein sorting in yeast. Receptors with intrinsic and associated tyrosine kinase activity recruit heterodimeric phosphoinositide-3 kinases that consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 adaptor molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. A phosphoinositide-3 kinase isotype, p110 gamma, was cloned and characterized. The p110 gamma enzyme was activated in vitro by both the alpha and beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) and did not interact with p85. A potential pleckstrin homology domain is located near its amino terminus. The p110 gamma isotype may link signaling through G protein-coupled receptors to the generation of phosphoinositide second messengers phosphorylated in the D-3 position.

7683036|t|Structure and functional expression of the human macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha/RANTES receptor.
7683036|a|The chemokine beta family is comprised of at least six distinct cytokines that regulate trafficking of phagocytes and lymphocytes in mammalian species; at least one of these, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), also regulates the growth of hematopoietic stem cells. We now show that MIP-1 alpha and the related beta chemokine, RANTES, induce transient alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in polymorphonuclear leukocytes that can be reciprocally and specifically desensitized, suggesting a common receptor. Moreover, we have now cloned both the cDNA and the gene for this receptor, functionally expressed the receptor in Xenopus oocytes, and mapped the gene to human chromosome 3p21. Transcripts for the receptor were found in mature and immature myeloid cells as well as B cells. The receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. It has approximately 33% amino acid identity with receptors for the alpha chemokine, interleukin 8, and may be the human homologue of the product of US28, an open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus.

7729684|t|p57KIP2, a structurally distinct member of the p21CIP1 Cdk inhibitor family, is a candidate tumor suppressor gene.
7729684|a|Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are positive regulators of cell proliferation, whereas Cdk inhibitors (CKIs) inhibit proliferation. We describe a new CKI, p57KIP2, which is related to p21CIP1 and p27KIP1. p57KIP2 is a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes, and its binding is cyclin dependent. Unlike CIP1, KIP2 is not regulated by p53. Overexpression of p57KIP2 arrests cells in G1. p57KIP2 proteins have a complex structure. Mouse p57KIP2 consists of four structurally distinct domains: an amino-terminal Cdk inhibitory domain, a proline-rich domain, an acidic-repeat region, and a carboxy-terminal domain conserved with p27KIP1. Human p57KIP2 appears to have conserved the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains but has replaced the internal regions with sequences containing proline-alanine repeats. In situ hybridization during mouse embryogenesis revealed that KIP2 mRNA displays a striking pattern of expression during development, showing high level expression in skeletal muscle, brain, heart, lungs, and eye. Most of the KIP2-expressing cells are terminally differentiated, suggesting that p57KIP2 is involved in decisions to exit the cell cycle during development and differentiation. Human KIP2 is located at 11p15.5, a region implicated in both sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial cancer syndrome, marking it as a candidate tumor suppressor. The discovery of a new member of the p21CIP1 inhibitor family with novel structural features and expression patterns suggests a complex role for these proteins in cell cycle control and development.

7790363|t|The human E48 antigen, highly homologous to the murine Ly-6 antigen ThB, is a GPI-anchored molecule apparently involved in keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion.
7790363|a|The E48 antigen, a putative human homologue of the 20-kD protein present in desmosomal preparations of bovine muzzle, and formerly called desmoglein III (dg4), is a promising target antigen for antibody-based therapy of squamous cell carcinoma in man. To anticipate the effect of high antibody dose treatment, and to evaluate the possible biological involvement of the antigen in carcinogenesis, we set out to molecularly characterize the antigen. A cDNA clone encoding the E48 antigen was isolated by expression cloning in COS cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the clone contained an open reading frame of 128 amino acids, encoding a core protein of 13,286 kD. Database searching showed that the E48 antigen has a high level of sequence similarity with the mouse ThB antigen, a member of the Ly-6 antigen family. Phosphatidylinositol-specific (PI-specific) phospholipase-C treatment indicated that the E48 antigen is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI-anchored) to the plasma membrane. The gene encoding the E48 antigen is a single copy gene, located on human chromosome 8 in the 8q24-qter region. The expression of the gene is confined to keratinocytes and squamous tumor cells. The putative mouse homologue, the ThB antigen, originally identified as an antigen on cells of the lymphocyte lineage, was shown to be highly expressed in squamous mouse epithelia. Moreover, the ThB expression level is in keratinocytes, in contrast to that in lymphocytes, not mouse strain related. Transfection of mouse SV40-polyoma transformed mouse NIH/3T3 cells with the E48 cDNA confirmed that the antigen is likely to be involved in cell-cell adhesion.

7806211|t|Molecular cloning of the cDNA for human TrkC (NTRK3), chromosomal assignment, and evidence for a splice variant.
7806211|a|TrkC is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by neurotrophin-3, a factor important in the development of certain areas of the central nervous system. We have cloned and sequenced the human trkC cDNA and found that the predicted amino acid sequence is 97 to 98% homologous to the rat and porcine trkC sequences, respectively. The rat trkC has several isoforms due to alternative splicing in the tyrosine kinase domain. We cloned one human splice variant that has a nucleic acid sequence identical to the rat isoform with an insert of 14 amino acids. The human trkC cDNA also has a (CGG)n repeat in the 5'-untranslated region. This sequence was not highly polymorphic in that 79 of 80 chromosomes examined had eight repeats, while 1 chromosome had four repeats. By PCR analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel and fluorescence in situ hybridization with the cDNA clone, human trkC was mapped to chromosome 15q24-q25.

7806230|t|Fibulin-2 (FBLN2): human cDNA sequence, mRNA expression, and mapping of the gene on human and mouse chromosomes.
7806230|a|Fibulin-2 is a new extracellular matrix protein that we recently identified by characterizing mouse cDNA clones. Fibulin-2 mRNA is prominently expressed in mouse heart tissue and is present in low amounts in other tissues. In this study, we isolated and sequenced a 4.1-kb human fibulin-2 cDNA, which encoded a mature protein of 1157 amino acids preceded by a 27-residue signal sequence. The predicted polypeptide contains three consecutive anaphylatoxin-related segments (domain I) in its central region followed by 10 EGF-like repeats (domain II), 9 of which have a consensus sequence for calcium binding. The 408-residue N-terminal region consists of two separate subdomains, a cysteine-rich segment of 150 residues (Na subdomain) and a cysteine-free segment with a stretch of acidic amino acids (Nb subdomain). The 115-residue C-terminal segment (domain III) is similar to the C variant of fibulin-1. The amino acid sequences of the human and mouse fibulin-2 share approximately 90% identity in domains Na, I, II, and III but only 62% identity in domain Nb. The human cDNA lacks an EGF-like repeat, which is alternatively spliced in the mouse cDNA clones, and a potential cell-binding Arg-Gly-Asp sequence found in the Nb domain of the mouse counterpart. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from various human tissues reveals an abundant 4.5-kb transcript in heart, placenta, and ovary tissue. The expression pattern differs from that of fibulin-1. The fibulin-2 gene was localized by in situ hybridization to the p24-p25 region of human chromosome 3 and to the band D-E of mouse chromosome 6.

7824954|t|Cloning of an intrinsic human TFIID subunit that interacts with multiple transcriptional activators.
7824954|a|TFIID is a multisubunit protein complex comprised of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TAFs in TFIID are essential for activator-dependent transcription. The cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a human TFIID TAF, TAFII55, that has no known homolog in Drosophila TFIID is now described. TAFII55 is shown to interact with the largest subunit (TAFII230) of human TFIID through its central region and with multiple activators--including Sp1, YY1, USF, CTF, adenoviral E1A, and human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 Tat proteins--through a distinct amino-terminal domain. The TAFII55-interacting region of Sp1 was localized to its DNA-binding domain, which is distinct from the glutamine-rich activation domains previously shown to interact with Drosophila TAFII110. Thus, this human TFIID TAF may be a co-activator that mediates a response to multiple activators through a distinct mechanism.

7876099|t|Expression and kinetic characterization of recombinant human stomach alcohol dehydrogenase. Active-site amino acid sequence explains substrate specificity compared with liver isozymes.
7876099|a|A full-length 1966-base pair clone of the human class IV alcohol dehydrogenase (sigma-ADH) was isolated from a human stomach cDNA library. The 373-amino acid sigma-ADH encoded by this cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme for ethanol oxidation at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, calculated from active-site titration of NADH binding, was 92 +/- 9 units/mg. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of recombinant sigma-ADH for oxidation of primary alcohols indicated broad substrate specificity. Recombinant human sigma-ADH exhibited high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. This pathway is important in the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator all-trans-retinoic acid. Secondary alcohols and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids were inactive with sigma-ADH or were oxidized with very low efficiency. The KM of sigma-ADH for ethanol was 25 mM, and the KM for primary straight chain alcohols decreased substantially as chain length increased. There are important amino acid differences in the alcohol-binding site between the human class IV (sigma) and human class I (beta) alcohol dehydrogenases that appear to explain the high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol, the high kcat for ethanol, and the low catalytic efficiency for secondary alcohols of sigma-ADH relative to beta 1-ADH. For example, modeling the binding of all-trans-retinol in the human beta 1-ADH structure suggested that coordination of retinol to the active-site zinc is hindered by a loop from residues 114 to 120 that is at the entrance to the alcohol-binding site. The deletion of Gly-117 in human sigma-ADH and a substitution of Leu for the bulky Tyr-110 appear to facilitate retinol access to the active-site zinc.

7905825|t|Cloning of human acetyl-CoA carboxylase cDNA.
7905825|a|Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biogenesis of long-chain fatty acids. In order to understand the mechanisms that regulate human acetyl-CoA carboxylase at the gene level, and the relationship between its structure and function, cDNA clones for human acetyl-CoA carboxylase have been isolated and sequenced. Human acetyl-CoA-carboxylase cDNA contains 7020 nucleotides encoding a protein of 2340 amino acids with a calculated relative molecular mass of 264575. The human enzyme shows approximately 85% identity in nucleotide sequence with previously cloned rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and shows 90% identity in the amino acid sequence. Two human acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA species, which differ in the 5' untranslated region with the same coding sequence, have been identified. The sequence analysis reveals that type I and type II acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA contain 313- and 173-base-long 5' untranslated regions, respectively. The first 240 nucleotides in the 5' untranslated region of type I acetyl-CoA-carboxylase mRNA replace the first 100 nucleotides of the (G + C)-rich region of the 5' untranslated region of the type II mRNA. These two species of mRNAs are the only species of human ACC mRNA which have been detected compared to at least five species in rat tissues, and they are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.

7905839|t|Human mu opiate receptor. cDNA and genomic clones, pharmacologic characterization and chromosomal assignment.
7905839|a|A human mu opiate receptor cDNA has been identified from a cerebral cortical cDNA library using sequences from the rat mu opiate receptor cDNA. The human mu opiate receptor (h mu OR1) shares 95% amino acid identity with the rat sequence. The expressed mu OR1 recognized tested opiate drugs and opioid peptides in a sodium- and GTP-sensitive fashion with affinities virtually identical to those displayed by the rat mu opiate receptor. Effects on cyclic AMP are similar to those noted for the rat mu opiate receptor. An 18 kb genomic clone hybridizing with the h mu OR1 cDNA contains 63 and 489 bp exonic sequences flanked by splice donor/acceptor sequences. Analysis of hybridization to DNA prepared from human rodent hybrid cell lines and chromosomal in situ hybridization studies indicate localization to 6q24-25. An MspI polymorphism, producing a 3.7 kb band, may prove useful in assessing this gene's involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders involving opiatergic systems.

7913309|t|Human cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase: expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant wild-type and Cys129 mutant enzymes.
7913309|a|A cDNA for the human cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase (EC 4.1.3.5) was subcloned and expressed from a T7-based vector in Escherichia coli. The over-produced enzyme was purified using a three-step protocol that generated 20 to 30 mg protein/liter cell culture. The physical and catalytic properties of the recombinant synthase are similar to those reported for the nonrecombinant enzymes from chicken liver [Clinkenbeard et al. (1975a) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3124-3135] and rat liver [Mehrabian et al. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16249-16255]. Mutation of Cys129 to serine or alanine destroys HMG-CoA synthase activity by disrupting the first catalytic step in HMG-CoA synthesis, enzyme acetylation by acetyl coenzyme A. Furthermore, unlike the wild-type enzyme, neither mutant was capable of covalent modification by the beta-lactone inhibitor, L-659,699 [Greenspan et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 7488-7492]. Kinetic analysis of the inhibition by L-659,699 revealed that this compound is a potent inhibitor of the recombinant human synthase, with an inhibition constant of 53.7 nM and an inactivation rate constant of 1.06 min-1.

7925449|t|Bradykinin induces translocation of the protein kinase C isoforms alpha, epsilon, and zeta.
7925449|a|Bradykinin exerts a broad spectrum of cellular effects on different tissues. It is believed that these effects are predominantly mediated by the recently cloned B2 receptor. The mechanism of post-receptor signal transduction is not known in detail. Involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) was suggested and activation of the classical PKC isoforms alpha and beta was recently demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the B2 receptor also activates new (delta, epsilon) and atypical (zeta) PKC isoforms. To investigate this, chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, stably transfected with human B2 receptor, were used. In these cells the PKC isoforms alpha, delta, epsilon and zeta were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. To monitor hormone-induced PKC translocation plasma membranes were prepared. Stimulation of the cells with bradykinin resulted in a rapid (30-60 s) translocation of the PKC isoforms alpha, epsilon, and zeta. Translocation of PKC delta was not detected. The effect of bradykinin was reduced by simultaneous addition of the receptor antagonist HOE 140, a bradykinin-related decapeptide. The data show that the B2 receptor in this cell model is able to activate, in addition to the classical PKC isoform alpha, the new PKC isoform epsilon and the atypical PKC isoform zeta. To test whether these effects are as well observed in a non-transfected cell, the experiments were repeated in human foreskin fibroblasts which naturally express high levels of B2 receptors. In this cell system similar results on PKC alpha, epsilon, and zeta were observed, suggesting that all three PKC isoforms are involved in signal transduction of the B2 receptor.

7925474|t|Protein structure of fetal antigen 1 (FA1). A novel circulating human epidermal-growth-factor-like protein expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and its relation to the gene products of dlk and pG2.
7925474|a|The present paper describes the primary structure, glycosylation and tissue localization of fetal antigen 1 (FA1) isolated from second-trimester human amniotic fluid. FA1 is a single-chained, heterogeneous glycoprotein of 225-262 amino acid residues. FA1 has six well conserved epidermal-growth-factor motifs and contains up to ten O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites, six of which are differentially glycosylated. Alignment to the translated sequences of Mus. musculus dlk and human dlk revealed 86% and 99% identity, respectively, to a 259-amino-acid residue overlap, and this high similarity extends with minor corrections to the human adrenal-specific mRNA, pG2 as well. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of FA1 in 10 out of 14 lung tumors containing neuroendocrine elements, and in the placental villi where FA1 was exclusively seen in stromal cells in close contact to the vascular structure. In the pancreas, FA1 co-localized with insulin in the insulin secretory granules of the beta cells within the islets of Langerhans. Our findings suggest that FA1 is synthesized as a membrane anchored protein and released into the circulation after enzymic cleavage, and that circulating FA1 represents the post-translationally modified gene product of human dlk which, in turn, is identical to human adrenal-specific mRNA pG2.

7957065|t|Human DNA helicase II: a novel DNA unwinding enzyme identified as the Ku autoantigen.
7957065|a|Human DNA helicase II (HDH II) is a novel ATP-dependent DNA unwinding enzyme, purified to apparent homogeneity from HeLa cells, which (i) unwinds exclusively DNA duplexes, (ii) prefers partially unwound substrates and (iii) proceeds in the 3' to 5' direction on the bound strand. HDH II is a heterodimer of 72 and 87 kDa polypeptides. It shows single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, as well as double-stranded DNA binding capacity. All these activities comigrate in gel filtration and glycerol gradients, giving a sedimentation coefficient of 7.4S and a Stokes radius of approximately 46 A, corresponding to a native molecular weight of 158 kDa. The antibodies raised in rabbit against either polypeptide can remove from the solution all the activities of HDH II. Photoaffinity labelling with [alpha-32P]ATP labelled both polypeptides. Microsequencing of the separate polypeptides of HDH II and cross-reaction with specific antibodies showed that this enzyme is identical to Ku, an autoantigen recognized by the sera of scleroderma and lupus erythematosus patients, which binds specifically to duplex DNA ends and is regulator of a DNA-dependent protein kinase. Recombinant HDH II/Ku protein expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli cells showed DNA binding and helicase activities indistinguishable from those of the isolated protein. The exclusively nuclear location of HDH II/Ku antigen, its highly specific affinity for double-stranded DNA, its abundance and its newly demonstrated ability to unwind exclusively DNA duplexes, point to an additional, if still unclear, role for this molecule in DNA metabolism.

7970727|t|BMX, a novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase gene of the BTK/ITK/TEC/TXK family located in chromosome Xp22.2.
7970727|a|The Bmx sequence was identified and cloned during our search for novel tyrosine kinase genes expressed in human bone marrow cells. Bmx cDNA comprises a long open reading frame of 675 amino acids, containing one SH3, one SH2 and one tyrosine kinase domain, which are about 70% identical with Btk, Itk and Tec and somewhat less with Txk tyrosine kinase sequences. The amino terminal sequences of these four tyrosine kinases are about 40% identical and each contains a so-called pleckstrin homology domain. The 2.7 kb Bmx mRNA was expressed in endothelial cells and several human tissues by Northern blotting and an 80 kD Bmx polypeptide was detected in human endothelial cells. Immunoprecipitates of COS cells transfected with a Bmx expression vector and NIH3T3 cells expressing a Bmx retrovirus contained a tyrosyl phosphorylated Bmx polypeptide of similar molecular weight. The BMX gene was located in chromosomal band Xp22.2 between the DXS197 and DXS207 loci. Interestingly, chromosome X also contains the closest relative of BMX, the BTK gene, implicated in X-linked agammaglobulinemia. The BMX gene thus encodes a novel nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, which may play a role in the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells.

8159699|t|Molecular cloning, sequencing, and functional expression of a cDNA encoding human coproporphyrinogen oxidase.
8159699|a|Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3) catalyzes the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, the oxidation of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX. The activity of this enzyme is deficient in the disease hereditary coproporphyria. The sequence of the cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence of the human coproporphyrinogen oxidase are presented. The human protein sequence contains a region completely homologous to that we obtained by sequencing an 11-amino acid peptide fragment from purified murine liver coproporphyrinogen oxidase. Results of Southern blotting were consistent with the presence of a single human coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene, and Northern blotting demonstrated one transcript of similar size in erythroid and nonerythroid cell lines. Expression of the cDNA coding for the putative mature human coproporphyrinogen oxidase in Escherichia coli resulted in a 17-fold increase in coproporphyrinogen activity over endogenous activity.

8182091|t|Human liver nicotinamide N-methyltransferase. cDNA cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization.
8182091|a|Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) catalyzes the N-methylation of nicotinamide and other pyridines. Human liver NNMT activity has a bimodal frequency distribution, an observation which raises the possibility that this enzyme activity might be regulated by a genetic polymorphism, a polymorphism that could have functional implications for individual differences in drug and xenobiotic toxicity. As a first step toward testing that hypothesis, we set out to clone and express a cDNA for human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT was partially purified, photoaffinity-labeled, subjected to limited proteolysis, and partial amino acid sequence information was obtained. The polymerase chain reaction was then used to amplify a 550-nucleotide sequence with human liver cDNA as template and primers designed on the basis of the NNMT amino acid sequence. The 5'- and 3'-ends of a human liver NNMT cDNA were obtained by use of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The combined use of these approaches resulted in the isolation of a human liver NNMT cDNA that was 969 nucleotides in length, with a 792-nucleotide open reading frame that encoded a 264-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29.6 kDa. The human liver NNMT cDNA was transcribed in vitro and translated with a reticulocyte lysate system to yield a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa that comigrated during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with photoaffinity-labeled human liver NNMT. The NNMT cDNA was also subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector p91023(B). COS-1 cells transfected with this construct expressed a high level of NNMT enzymatic activity, and the biochemical properties of this activity were similar to those of human liver NNMT. Human liver NNMT and transfected COS-1 cell NNMT had apparent Km values for the two cosubstrates for the reaction, nicotinamide and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, of 0.43 and 0.38 mM and of 1.8 and 2.2 microM, respectively. IC50 values for the inhibition of NNMT by N1-methylnicotinamide were 60 and 30 microns for human liver and COS-1 cell-expressed NNMT, respectively. Cloning of a cDNA for human liver NNMT will help make it possible to test the hypothesis that inheritance may play a role in the regulation of individual differences in human liver NNMT activity.

8204608|t|Purification and characterization of the recombinant human calcium-binding S100 proteins CAPL and CACY.
8204608|a|The S100 proteins CAPL and CACY are expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner and have been reported to be associated with the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells. In order to study the biochemical, cation-binding, and conformational properties, we produced and purified large amounts of the recombinant human proteins in Escherichia coli. Several characteristics of native proteins are shown to correspond to those of the bacterially expressed proteins. Both are able to form homodimers in vitro, probably the biologically active species, but not heterodimers. The Ca(2+)-binding parameters were studied by flow offlysis at physiological ionic strength. Both isotherms show a maximum of two Ca2+ per protein and are insensitive to Mg2+, indicating that the sites are of the Ca(2+)-specific type. The isotherms show slight (CAPL, nH = 1.15) or pronounced (CACY, nH = 1.33) positive cooperativity with K0.5 values of 0.32 mM (CACY) and 0.15 mM (CAPL), indicating that the sites are of the low-affinity type. Conformational changes in the Tyr microenvironment of CACY indicate that Ca2+ binding induces a shift of Tyr to a less polar environment. Mg2+ does not affect the fluorescence properties nor does it induce a difference spectrum, thus suggesting that at physiological ionic conditions it does not interact with the protein. The Ca(2+)-induced difference spectra of CAPL are about 3 times smaller than those of CACY, suggesting that the additional Tyr84 in CACY is much more sensitive to Ca2+ than the two Tyr residues conserved in both proteins.

8224247|a|We have been using a differential cDNA cloning approach to isolate human retina-specific and retina-enriched genes [1]. A 1,314 bp cDNA was isolated by this approach, representing a highly retina-specific message encoding a 388 amino acid protein showing 58%, 50%, and 49% homology to bovine beta-arrestin, and bovine and human retinal arrestin (S-antigen), respectively. Chromosomal mapping localized this new arrestin gene to the proximal long arm of the X chromosome, hence it was named X-arrestin. In situ hybridization demonstrated its expression in the inner and outer segments and the inner plexiform regions of the retina.

8243272|t|Human G(olf) alpha: complementary deoxyribonucleic acid structure and expression in pancreatic islets and other tissues outside the olfactory neuroepithelium and central nervous system.
8243272|a|G(olf) alpha is a G-protein originally believed to mediate signal transduction exclusively within the olfactory neuroepithelium and subsequently found to be a major stimulatory G-protein in the basal ganglia. Here we present evidence that G(olf) alpha is expressed in several other tissues. The human isoform of G(olf) alpha was isolated from two human insulinoma cDNA libraries. Comparison of the human sequence with rat G(olf) alpha shows 91% nucleotide identity (within the coding region) and 99% identity at the amino acid level. Northern and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that G(olf) alpha is expressed in all human insulinomas examined thus far as well as in normal pancreatic islets. G(olf) alpha mRNA was also detected in testis, retina, brain, and liver. Western blot analysis of various mouse tissues demonstrated that the level of G(olf) alpha protein in islets is lower than that in the olfactory neuroepithelium and other parts of the brain; its expression in retina, lung, and spleen was moderately higher than that in islets, and its expression in testis approached that in olfactory neuroepithelium. G(olf) alpha was also detected by immunohistochemistry in mouse islets, human insulinomas, the epithelial lining of mouse epididymis, photoreceptor cells of mouse retina, and mouse lung alveoli. These findings suggest a role for G(olf) alpha in a diverse population of cells located outside the olfactory neuroepithelium and central nervous system.

8248204|t|cDNAs encoding the large subunit of human replication factor C.
8248204|a|Replication factor C (RFC) is a multisubunit, DNA polymerase accessory protein required for the coordinated synthesis of both DNA strands during simian virus 40 DNA replication in vitro. Previous studies have shown that RFC is a DNA-dependent ATPase that binds in a structure-specific manner to the 3' end of a primer hybridized to a template DNA, an activity thought intrinsic to the 140-kDa component of this multisubunit complex. Here, the isolation and analysis of cDNAs encoding this subunit is described. Analysis of the full-length coding sequence revealed an open reading frame of 3.4 kb, encoding an 1148-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 130 kDa. A putative ATP-binding motif was observed that is similar to a motif in several of the smaller subunits of RFC and in functionally homologous replication factors of bacterial and viral origin. A " DEAD " box is also conserved among these proteins. The predicted protein shows significant identity with a DNA-binding protein of murine origin (B. Luckow, P. Lichter, and G. Schütz, personal communication). Regions of similarity were also seen between the amino acid sequences of the 140-kDa subunit of RFC, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and bacterial DNA ligases--possibly representing a conserved structural feature of these proteins that bind similar DNA substrates.

8248209|t|Molecular cloning and centrosomal localization of human caltractin.
8248209|a|Caltractin, a 20-kDa calcium-binding protein, was previously purified and cloned at the DNA level from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas. It is a structural component of the basal body complex, the major microtubule-organizing center in Chlamydomonas and the functional homolog of the centrosome in the animal cell. Here we report the characterization of a cDNA encoding a human caltractin that shares a high degree of amino acid identity (70%) with its algal counterpart. Caltractin was identified in both HeLa and BHK cells as a 21-kDa polypeptide specifically localized to the centrosome of interphase and mitotic cells. The high level of conservation in the amino acid sequence of caltractin from algae to humans and its association with the major microtubule-organizing center in the cell suggest that caltractin plays a fundamental role in microtubule-organizing center structure and function.

The ubiquitous expression pattern of Nrf1 and the range of promoters containing the NF-E2 binding motif suggest that this gene may play a role in the regulation of heme synthesis and ferritin genes.

Three independent plaque clones containing the human TrsVal cDNA were then isolated from a lambda gt10 human erythroleukemia cDNA library using the rat cDNA fragment as the hybridization probe. Sequence analyses of the cDNA fragments provided a 3.2-kb sequence with an open reading frame that contained the 'HIGH' synthetase signature sequence and the tRNA 3'-end-binding motif, KMSKS, and putative Val-binding motif, EWCISRQ. The sequence was extended to the 3' end of the cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction using an internal primer and an oligo(dT) adapter. The deduced 1051-amino-acid sequence shares 65% identity with yeast TrsVal, and contains a highly basic N-terminal region, a newly evolved protease-sensitive region in sequence close to the C terminus, and several sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation. A 3-kb cDNA fragment was sub-cloned into plasmid pSVL and expressed in COS-7 cells; up to a sevenfold increase in TrsVal activity was obtained. These results confirm the cloning and sequencing of a human TrsVal-encoding cDNA.

8428750|t|Localization of the intronless gene coding for calmodulin-like protein CLP to human chromosome 10p13-ter.
8428750|a|The functional intronless gene coding for a calmodulin-like protein (CLP) has been localized to human chromosome 10p13-ter. Chromosomal assignment was performed by Southern blot analysis of DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids and amplification of a CLP gene-specific 1090-bp DNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA from human-hamster cell hybrids. Chromosomal sublocalization was carried out by in situ hybridization of human chromosome metaphase spreads. The CLP gene is the first member of the human calmodulin/calmodulin-like gene family to be chromosomally sublocalized. Its presence near the telomeric end of the short arm of chromosome 10 may be of significance with respect to its highly (epithelial) cell-type restricted expression in vivo and strong downregulation upon malignant transformation. The generation of a human CLP gene-specific sequence tag site specified by the two primers used for PCR should prove useful for future linkage studies.

8486631|t|A novel form of cytochrome P-450 family 4 in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. cDNA cloning and expression of leukotriene B4 omega-hydroxylase.
8486631|a|Isolation of cDNA clones for human leukotriene B4 (LTB4) omega-hydroxylase clearly demonstrates that the hydroxylase is a member of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) superfamily. cDNA clones isolated from a human leukocyte cDNA library with CYP4A4 cDNA as a probe encode a protein of 520 amino acids with a molecular weight of 59,805. The deduced amino acid sequence contains an invariant cysteine in the conserved heme-binding domain near the C terminus, characteristic of the P-450 superfamily. The microsomes from yeast cells transfected with an expression vector pAAH5 carrying isolated cDNA catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of LTB4 with a Km value of 0.71 microM, and its activity was significantly inhibited by carbon monoxide and by antisera against CYP4A4, consistent with the properties previously reported with LTB4 omega-hydroxylase in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The amino acid sequence of LTB4 omega-hydroxylase (P-450LTB omega) shows 31-44% similarity to those of CYP4A, CYP4B, and CYP4C, whereas less than 25% similarity was observed with any of the other P-450 families. According to the systematic classification of the P-450 superfamily, P-450LTB omega is classified into the CYP4 family but does not belong to any of the known CYP4 subfamilies. This P-450 composes a new subfamily of CYP4. RNA blot analysis indicated that mRNA hybridized to the cDNA was expressed in the polymorphonuclear leukocytes as well as leukocytes from four individuals. Isolation of the cDNA opens the way to investigate the physiological role and to regulation of the omega-hydroxylase in the inflammation process.

8486689|t|Molecular cloning of the cDNA for the catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase epsilon.
8486689|a|The cDNA encoding the catalytic polypeptide of human DNA polymerase epsilon was cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals that the catalytic polypeptide is 2257 amino acids in length and its calculated molecular mass is 258 kDa. A single RNA message of 7.5 kilobases was recognized by isolated cDNA clones. The identity of the cDNA was verified by direct amino acid sequencing of tryptic fragments derived from the catalytic polypeptide of the HeLa DNA polymerase epsilon. The primary structure comparison with multiple DNA polymerases indicates that human DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic polypeptide is a homolog of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase II catalytic polypeptide. The proteins are 39% identical. In the region containing known DNA polymerase consensus motifs, the identity is 63%. The expression of the mRNA encoding DNA polymerase epsilon is strongly dependent on cell proliferation.

8555498|t|LAF-4 encodes a lymphoid nuclear protein with transactivation potential that is homologous to AF-4, the gene fused to MLL in t(4;11) leukemias.
8555498|a|A novel human gene, LAF-4, was isolated from a subtracted cDNA library that showed strong sequence similarity to AF-4, a gene that is translocated in t(4;11)(q21;q23) acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). In t(4;11) ALL, the AF-4 gene at 4q21 is translocated into the MLL locus at 11q23, resulting in the expression of an MLL/AF-4 fusion protein that is the presumptive oncoprotein. AF-4 and LAF-4 are homologous throughout their coding regions, yet neither protein is related to previously cloned genes. Human LAF-4 readily hybridized with genes in mouse and chicken, thus showing that this gene family has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. In mouse tissues, LAF-4 mRNA was found to be present at highest levels in lymphoid tissues, present at lower levels in brain and lung, and absent from other tissues. In human and mouse lymphoid cell lines, LAF-4 expression was highest in pre-B cells, intermediate in mature B cells, and absent in plasma cells, thus pointing to a potential regulatory role for LAF-4 in lymphoid development. Antibodies to LAF-4 showed it to be a nuclear protein that showed an uneven, granular immunofluorescence pattern. In vitro-translated LAF-4 was able to bind strongly to double-stranded DNA cellulose. Furthermore, both LAF-4 and AF-4 had domains that activated transcription strongly when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, the AF-4 transactivation domain is retained in the MLL/AF-4 fusion protein; thus, it may contribute to the transforming potential of the oncoprotein. Therefore, the cloning of LAF-4 has defined a new family of potential regulatory proteins that may function in lymphoid development and oncogenesis.

8579579|a|Autotaxin, a potent human tumor cell motility-stimulating exophosphodiesterase, was isolated and cloned from the human teratocarcinoma cell line NTera2D1. The deduced amino acid sequence for the teratocarcinoma autotaxin has 94% identity to the melanoma-derived protein, 90% identity to rat brain phosphodiesterase I/nucleotide pyrophosphatase (PD-I alpha), and 44% identity to the plasma cell membrane marker PC-I. Utilizing polymerase chain reaction screening of the CEPH YAC library, we localized the autotaxin gene to human chromosome 8q23-24. Northern blot analysis of relative mRNA from multiple human tissues revealed that autotaxin mRNA steady state expression is most abundant in brain, placenta, ovary, and small intestine.

8579597|a|A cDNA encoding a possible novel human 116-kDa polypeptide subunit of the osteoclastic proton pump (OC-116KDa) has been identified by differential screening of a human osteoclastoma cDNA library. The predicted sequence of OC-116kDa consists of 822 amino acids and is 46.9% and 47.2% identical at the amino acid level to the 116-KDa polypeptide of the vacuolar proton pump of rat and bovine brain respectively. OC-116KDa mRNA was found at high levels in osteoclastomas by Northern analysis but was not detected in tumor stromal cells or in other tissues including kidney, liver, skeletal muscle and brain. OC-116KDa mRNA was localized to multinucleated giant cells within the osteoclastoma tumor by in situ hybridization.

8581736|t|Cloning, sequencing and expression of a novel cDNA encoding human vacuolar ATPase (14-kDa subunit).
8581736|a|A cDNA encoding the 14-kDa subunit of vacuolar ATPase was cloned from human fetal brain. The sequence was composed of 680 nucleotides containing an open reading frame of 357 nucleotides. The deduced peptide sequence consisted of 119 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 13,369 Da and a pI of 5.19. Overall, this amino-acid sequence was respectively 69% and 70% identical to those of Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster 14-kDa subunits, although the two representatives of Class Insecta were remarkably similar to one another (91% identity). Three regions in particular (the N-terminal, amino acids 5-36; the middle, residues 58-68; and the C-terminal, residues 88-118) were highly conserved. Hence, we think that the 14-kDa subunits have evolved from the same ancestral gene, and that the three conserved regions are important for the structure and function of vacuolar ATPase. A single 0.8-kb band was detected in various human tissues by Northern blot analysis. Since the human 14-kDa subunit is expressed ubiquitously, it might be a housekeeping protein. A separate transcript found in the cDNA library lacked a 6-bp segment in the 5' non-coding region (nucleotides -40 to -35) and also carried a 23C to T (8Thr to Ile) point mutation in the coding region; these minor differences likely reflected normal polymorphism.

8612563|t|Cloning and characterization of human urocortin.
8612563|a|Urocortin, a new member of the CRF peptide family which also includes urotensin I and sauvagine, was recently cloned from the rat midbrain. The synthetic replicate of urocortin was found to bind with high affinity to type 1 and type 2 CRF receptors and, based upon its anatomic localization within the brain, was proposed to be a natural ligand for the type 2 CRF receptors. Using a genomic library, we have cloned the human counterpart of rat urocortin and localized it to human chromosome 2. Human and rat urocortin share 95% identity within the mature peptide region. Synthetic human urocortin binds with high affinity to CRF receptor types 1, 2 alpha, and 2 beta, stimulates cAMP accumulation from cells stably transfected with these receptors, and acts in vitro to release ACTH from dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. In addition, the CRF-binding protein binds human urocortin with high affinity and can prevent urocortin-stimulated ACTH secretion in vitro. The inhibitory effect of the CRF-binding protein on human urocortin can be blocked by biologically inactive CRF fragments, such as CRF(9-33).

8632143|t|Molecular cloning, expression, and chromosomal localization of a human brain-specific Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter.
8632143|a|We describe the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a human brain Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate (P(i)) cotransporter (hBNPI). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of hBNPI reveal a protein of 560 amino acids with six to eight putative transmembrane segments. hBNPI shares a high degree of homology with other Na(+)-dependent inorganic P(i) cotransporters, including those found in rat brain and human and rabbit kidney. Expression of hBNPI in COS-1 cells results in Na(+)-dependent P(i) uptake. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that hBNPI mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain and most abundantly in neuron-enriched regions such as the amygdala and hippocampus. Moderate levels of expression are also observed in glia-enriched areas such as the corpus callosum, and low levels are observed in the substantia nigra, subthalamic nuclei, and thalamus. In situ hybridization histochemistry reveals relatively high levels of hBNPI mRNA in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and in granule neurons of dentate gyrus. The level of hBNPI mRNA is quite low in fetal compared with adult human brain, suggesting developmental regulation of hBNPI gene expression. Southern analyses of nine eukaryotic genomic DNAs probed under stringent conditions with hBNPI cDNA revealed that the hBNPI gene is highly conserved during vertebrate evolution and that each gene is most likely present as a single copy. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we localized hBNPI to the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13) in close proximity to the late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease locus.

8643544|t|In its active form, the GTP-binding protein rab8 interacts with a stress-activated protein kinase.
8643544|a|Rab8 is a small GTP-binding protein that plays a role in vesicular transport from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral plasma membrane in polarized epithelial cells (MDCK), and to the dendritic surface in hippocampal neurons. As is the case for most other rab proteins, the precise molecular interactions by which rab8 carries out its function remain to be elucidated. Here we report the identification and the complete cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of a murine rab8-interacting protein (rab8ip) that specifically interacts with rab8 in a GTP-dependent manner. Rab8ip displays 93% identity with the GC kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase recently identified in human lymphoid tissue that is activated in the stress response. Like the GC kinase, rab8ip has protein kinase activity manifested by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the classical serine/threonine protein kinase substrates, myelin basic protein and casein. When coexpressed in transfected 293T cells, rab8 and the rab8ip/GC kinase formed a complex that could be recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to rab8. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence analyses indicate that in MDCK cells endogenous rab8ip is present both in the cytosol and as a peripheral membrane protein concentrated in the Golgi region and basolateral plasma membrane domains, sites where rab8 itself is also located. In light of recent evidence that rab proteins may act by promoting the stabilization of SNARE complexes, the specific GTP-dependent association of rab8 with the rab8ip/GC kinase raises the possibility that rab-regulated protein phosphorylation is important for vesicle targeting or fusion. Moreover, the rab8ip/GC kinase may serve to modulate secretion in response to stress stimuli.

8643547|t|Distinct pharmacological properties and distribution in neurons and endocrine cells of two isoforms of the human vesicular monoamine transporter.
8643547|a|A second isoform of the human vesicular monoamine transporter (hVMAT) has been cloned from a pheochromocytoma cDNA library. The contribution of the two transporter isoforms to monoamine storage in human neuroendocrine tissues was examined with isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies against hVMAT1 and hVMAT2. Central, peripheral, and enteric neurons express only VMAT2. VMAT1 is expressed exclusively in neuroendocrine, including chromaffin and enterochromaffin, cells. VMAT1 and VMAT2 are coexpressed in all chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. VMAT2 alone is expressed in histamine-storing enterochromaffin-like cells of the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach. The transport characteristics and pharmacology of each VMAT isoform have been directly compared after expression in digitonin-permeabilized fibroblastic (CV-1) cells, providing information about substrate feature recognition by each transporter and the role of vesicular monoamine storage in the mechanism of action of psychopharmacologic and neurotoxic agents in human. Serotonin has a similar affinity for both transporters. Catecholamines exhibit a 3-fold higher affinity, and histamine exhibits a 30-fold higher affinity, for VMAT2. Reserpine and ketanserin are slightly more potent inhibitors of VMAT2-mediated transport than of VMAT1-mediated transport, whereas tetrabenazine binds to and inhibits only VMAT2. N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, phenylethylamine, amphetamine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine are all more potent inhibitors of VMAT2 than of VMAT1, whereas fenfluramine is a more potent inhibitor of VMAT1-mediated monamine transport than of VMAT2-mediated monoamine transport. The unique distributions of hVMAT1 and hVMAT2 provide new markers for multiple neuroendocrine lineages, and examination of their transport properties provides mechanistic insights into the pharmacology and physiology of amine storage in cardiovascular, endocrine, and central nervous system function.

8647900|t|MDC9, a widely expressed cellular disintegrin containing cytoplasmic SH3 ligand domains.
8647900|a|Cellular disintegrins are a family of proteins that are related to snake venom integrin ligands and metalloproteases. We have cloned and sequenced the mouse and human homologue of a widely expressed cellular disintegrin, which we have termed MDC9 (for metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich protein 9). The deduced mouse and human protein sequences are 82% identical. MDC9 contains several distinct protein domains: a signal sequence is followed by a prodomain and a domain with sequence similarity to snake venom metalloproteases, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an EGF repeat, a membrane anchor, and a cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of MDC9 has two proline-rich sequences which can bind the SH3 domain of Src, and may therefore function as SH3 ligand domains. Western blot analysis shows that MDC9 is an approximately 84-kD glycoprotein in all mouse tissues examined, and in NIH 3T3 fibroblast and C2C12 myoblast mouse cell lines. MDC9 can be both cell surface biotinylated and 125I-labeled in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, indicating that the protein is present on the plasma membrane. Expression of MDC9 in COS-7 cells yields an 84-kD protein, and immunofluorescence analysis of COS-7 cells expressing MDC9 shows a staining pattern that is consistent with a plasma membrane localization. The apparent molecular mass of 84 kD suggests that MDC9 contains a membrane-anchored metalloprotease and disintegrin domain. We propose that MDC9 might function as a membrane-anchored integrin ligand or metalloprotease, or that MDC9 may combine both activities in one protein.

8651283|t|A GLRA1 null mutation in recessive hyperekplexia challenges the functional role of glycine receptors.
8651283|a|Dominant missense mutations in the human glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha 1 subunit gene (GLRA1) give rise to hereditary hyperekplexia. These mutations impair agonist affinities and change conductance states of expressed mutant channels, resulting in a partial loss of function. In a recessive case of hyperekplexia, we found a deletion of exons 1-6 of the GLRA1 gene. Born to consanguineous parents, the affected child is homozygous for this GLRA1(null) allele consistent with a complete loss of gene function. The child displayed exaggerated startle responses and pronounced head-retraction jerks reflecting a disinhibition of vestigial brain-stem reflexes. In contrast, proprio- and exteroceptive inhibition of muscle activity previously correlated to glycinergic mechanisms were not affected. This case demonstrates that, in contrast to the lethal effect of a null allele in the recessive mouse mutant oscillator (Glra1 spd-ot), the loss of the GlyR alpha 1 subunit is effectively compensated in man.

8663110|t|Induction of apoptosis by Apo-2 ligand, a new member of the tumor necrosis factor cytokine family.
8663110|a|Cytokines in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family regulate development and function of the immune system. We have isolated a new member of this family, designated Apo-2 ligand (Apo-2L), via an expressed sequence tag. Apo-2L is a 281-amino acid protein, related most closely to Fas/Apo-1 ligand. Transfected Apo-2L is expressed at the cell surface with its C terminus exposed, indicating a type II transmembrane protein topology. Like Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, the C-terminal extracellular region of Apo-2L (amino acids 114-281) exhibits a homotrimeric subunit structure. Soluble Apo-2L induces extensive apoptosis in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid tumor cell lines. The effect of Apo-2L is not inhibited by soluble Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors; moreover, expression of human Fas/Apo-1 in mouse fibroblasts, which confers sensitivity to induction of apoptosis by agonistic anti-Fas/Apo-1 antibody, does not confer sensitivity to Apo-2L. Hence, Apo-2L acts via a receptor which is distinct from Fas/Apo-1 and TNF receptors. These results suggest that, along with other family members such as Fas/Apo-1 ligand and TNF, Apo-2L may serve as an extracellular signal that triggers programmed cell death.

8663203|a|The glycosylation of serine and threonine residues during mucin-type O-linked protein glycosylation is carried out by a family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-transferase). Previously two members, GalNAc-T1 and -T2, have been isolated and the genes cloned and characterized. Here we report the cDNA cloning and expression of a novel GalNAc-transferase termed GalNAc-T3. The gene was isolated and cloned based on the identification of a GalNAc-transferase motif (61 amino acids) that is shared between GalNAc-T1 and -T2 as well as a homologous Caenorhabditis elegans gene. The cDNA sequence has a 633-amino acid coding region indicating a protein of 72.5 kDa with a type II domain structure. The overall amino acid sequence similarity with GalNAc-T1 and -T2 is approximately 45%; 12 cysteine residues that are shared between GalNAc-T1 and -T2 are also found in GalNAc-T3. GalNAc-T3 was expressed as a soluble protein without the hydrophobic transmembrane domain in insect cells using a Baculo-virus vector, and the expressed GalNAc-transferase activity showed substrate specificity different from that previously reported for GalNAc-T1 and -T2. Northern analysis of human organs revealed a very restricted expression pattern of GalNAc-T3.

8663286|t|Characterization of multiple mRNAs that encode mammalian translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5).
8663286|a|Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5) interacts with the 40 S initiation complex (40S.mRNA.MettRNAf.eIF-2.GTP) to promote the hydrolysis of bound GTP with the concomitant joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S initiation complex to form a functional 80 S initiation complex. In this paper, the multiple mRNAs that encode mammalian eIF-5 have been characterized. In rat tissues, three major eIF-5 mRNAs of 3.5, 2.8, and 2.2 kilobases in length are detected. All major eIF-5 mRNAs are initiated from a single transcription initiation site, contain identical 5'-untranslated and coding regions, but differ from one another only in the length of their 3'-untranslated regions. The different lengths of the 3'-untranslated region of eIF-5 mRNAs are generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. Additionally, we demonstrate tissue-specific variations in eIF-5 mRNA expression as well as preference for polyadenylation sites. These results should lead to increased understanding of the regulation of eIF-5 gene expression.

8679694|t|Molecular cloning, expression and function of the murine CB2 peripheral cannabinoid receptor.
8679694|a|We have cloned the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, mCB2, from a mouse splenocyte cDNA library. The 3.7 kb sequence contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 347 residues sharing 82% overall identity with the only other known peripheral receptor, human CB2 (hCB2) and shorter than hCB2 by 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Binding experiments with membranes from COS-3 cells transiently expressing mCB2 showed that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55212-2 had a 6-fold lower affinity for mCB2 than for hCB2, whereas both receptors showed similar affinities for the agonists CP 55,940, delta(9)-THC and anandamide and almost no affinity for the central receptor- (CB1) specific antagonist SR 141716A. Both hCB2 and mCB2 mediate agonist-stimulated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO cell lines permanently expressing the receptors. SR 141716A failed to antagonize this activity in either cell line, confirming its specificity for CB1.

8717357|t|The human glycine receptor beta subunit: primary structure, functional characterisation and chromosomal localisation of the human and murine genes.
8717357|a|The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) is a pentameric receptor comprised of alpha and beta subunits, of which the beta subunit has not been characterised in humans. A 2106 bp cDNA, isolated from a human hippocampal cDNA library, contained an open reading frame of 497 amino acids which encodes the beta subunit of the human GlyR. The mature human GlyR beta polypeptide displays 99% amino acid identity with the rat GlyR beta subunit and 48% identity with the human GlyR alpha 1 subunit. Neither [3H]strychnine binding nor glycine-gated currents were detected when the human GlyR beta subunit cDNA was expressed in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. However, co-expression of the beta subunit cDNA with the alpha 1 subunit cDNA resulted in expression of functional GlyRs which showed a 4-fold reduction in the EC50 values when compared to alpha 1 homomeric GlyRs. Glycine-gated currents of alpha 1/beta GlyRs were 17-fold less sensitive than homomeric alpha 1 GlyRs to the antagonists picrotoxin, picrotoxinin and picrotin, providing clear evidence that heteromeric alpha 1/beta GlyRs were expressed. The beta subunit appears to play a structural rather than ligand binding role in GlyR function. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was used to localise the gene encoding the human GlyR beta subunit (GLRB) to chromosome 4q32, a position syntenic with mouse chromosome 3. In situ hybridisation using the human GlyR beta subunit cDNA showed that the murine GlyR beta subunit gene (Glrb) maps to the spastic (spa) locus on mouse chromosome 3 at bands E3-F1. This is consistent with the recent finding that a mutation in the murine GlyR beta subunit causes the spa phenotype. It also raises the possibility that mutations in the human beta subunit gene may cause inherited disorders of the startle response.

8751386|t|Coding sequence and chromosome mapping of the human gene (CDC46) for replication protein hCdc46/Mcm5.
8751386|a|We have isolated the complete cDNA sequence encoding the human homolog of the yeast replication protein Cdc46/Mcm5. The cDNA was used as a probe for chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which localized the human Cdc46 gene (CDC46) to chromosome region 22q13.1-->q13.2. This is the fourth human Mcm gene whose chromosome region has been determined, and it is now apparent that human Mcm genes are widely distributed in the genome. As deduced from the cDNA sequence, human protein hCdc46 is composed of 734 amino acids and contains a central region that is almost 80% identical with the yeast protein. Immunoprecipitation experiments with hCdc46-specific antibodies confirm that essentially all nuclear hCdc46 proteins form a stable dimeric complex with protein P1Mcm3.

8755601|t|kappa opioid receptors in human microglia downregulate human immunodeficiency virus 1 expression.
8755601|a|Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain, play an important role in the neuropathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and recent studies suggest that opioid peptides regulate the function of macrophages from somatic tissues. We report herein the presence of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in human fetal microglia and inhibition of HIV-1 expression in acutely infected microglial cell cultures treated with KOR ligands. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analyses, we found that mRNA for the KOR was constitutively expressed in microglia and determined that the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame was identical to that of the human brain KOR gene. The expression of KOR in microglial cells was confirmed by membrane binding of [3H]U69,593, a kappa-selective ligand, and by indirect immunofluorescence. Treatment of microglial cell cultures with U50,488 or U69,593 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of expression of the monocytotropic HIV-1 SF162 strain. This antiviral effect of the kappa ligands was blocked by the specific KOR antagonist, nor-binaltrophimine. These findings suggest that kappa opioid agonists have immunomodulatory activity in the brain, and that these compounds could have potential in the treatment of HIV-1-associated encephalopathy.

8774743|t|cDNA cloning and functional analysis of the p97 subunit of the 26S proteasome, a polypeptide identical to the type-1 tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated protein-2/55.11.
8774743|a|Molecular cloning of cDNA for a new regulatory subunit, designated p97, of the human 26S proteasome showed that the polypeptide consists of 908 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 100184 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.94. Computer analysis showed that p97 is very similar to type-1 tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-receptor-associated protein (TRAP)-2 and 55.11, both of which were identified recently as binding proteins of the cytoplasmic domain of type-1 TNF receptor by yeast two-hybrid screening. This finding suggests that the 26S proteasome might serve as a mediator molecule in the TNF signaling pathway in cells. Computer-assisted similarity analysis also revealed the high sequence similarity of p97 with a yeast protein whose function is yet unknown, the gene for which is here termed NAS1 (non-ATPase subunit 1). Disruption of NAS1 resulted in several phenotypes, including lethality and temperature-sensitive growth, depending on the genetic background of the cells used. The human p97 cDNA suppressed the growth defect of nas1 disruptant cells, when expressed from single-copy or multi-copy vectors, indicating that p97 is functionally equivalent to yeast Nas1p. Culturing of the temperature-sensitive nas1 cells at the restrictive temperature promoted the accumulation polyubiquitinated cellular proteins, implying that the 26S proteasome requires a functional Nas1p subunit for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These results indicate that p97/Nas1p plays an important regulatory role in the function of the 26S proteasome.

8774881|t|Receptor-associated Mad homologues synergize as effectors of the TGF-beta response.
8774881|a|Transforming growth factor-beta TGF-beta is the prototype for a family of extracellular proteins that affect cell proliferation and tissue differentiation. TGF-beta-related factors, including BMP-2/4, Dpp and activin, act through two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors which can form a heteromeric complex. However, the mechanism of signal transduction by these receptors is largely unknown. In Drosophila, Mad is required for signalling by Dpp. We have isolated complementary DNAs for four human Mad homologues, one of which, hMAD-4, is identical to DPC-4, a candidate tumour suppressor. hMAD-3 and -4 synergized to induce strong ligand-independent TGF-beta-like responses. When truncated at their carboxy termini, hMAD-3 and -4 act as dominant-negative inhibitors of the normal TGF-beta response. The activity of hMAD-3 and -4 was regulated by the TGF-beta receptors, and hMAD-3 but not hMAD-4 was phosphorylated and associated with the ligand-bound receptor complex. These results define hMAD-3 and -4 as effectors of the TGF-beta response and demonstrate a function for DPCA-4/hMAD-4 as a tumour suppressor.

8798744|t|Cell-cell adhesion mediated by binding of membrane-anchored ligand LERK-2 to the EPH-related receptor human embryonal kinase 2 promotes tyrosine kinase activity.
8798744|a|Human embryonal kinase 2 (HEK2) is a protein-tyrosine kinase that is a member of the EPH family of receptors. Transcripts for HEK2 have a wide tissue distribution. Recently, a still growing family of ligands, which we have named LERKs, for ligands of the eph-related kinases, has been isolated. In order to analyze functional effects between the LERKs and the HEK2 receptor, we expressed HEK2 cDNA in an interleukin-3-dependent progenitor cell line 32D that grows as single cells in culture. Within the group of LERKs, LERK-2 and -5 were shown to bind to HEK2. Membrane-bound and soluble forms of LERK-2 were demonstrated to signal through HEK2 as judged by receptor phosphorylation. Coincubation of HEK2 and LERK-2 expressing cells induced cell-cell adhesion and formation of cell aggregates. This interaction could be inhibited by preincubation of HEK2 expressing cells with soluble LERK-2. Coexpression of HEK2 and LERK-2 in 32D cells showed reduced kinase activity and autophosphorylation of HEK2 compared with the juxtacrine stimulation, which seems to be due to a reduced sensitivity of the receptor.

8831703|t|Expression of the receptor protein tyrosine kinase myk-1/htk in normal and malignant mammary epithelium.
8831703|a|We have recently reported the molecular characterization of a novel murine receptor PTK (myk-1), belonging to the eph-related family, whose expression was differentially regulated during mammary gland development and elevated in invasive mouse mammary tumours. In this communication we have investigated the cellular origin of myk-1 expression by in situ hybridisation and RNase protection. Murine antisense myk-1 probe specifically recognised ductal and alveolar epithelium in the resting mouse mammary gland. In normal human breast, the expression of htk, the human homologue, was also confined to the secretory luminal epithelial cells. RNase protection analysis of enriched luminal and myoepithelial cells prepared from human reduction mammoplasty tissue confirmed the luminal specificity. Elevated expression of htk was found in several human breast carcinoma cell lines as well as in primary, high grade, infiltrating, ductal carcinomas of the breast. The specific epithelial expression of the myk-1/htk receptor PTK suggest a specialised role of this eph-related PTK in the differentiation and/or maintenance of secretory epithelium in the adult.

8912632|t|cDNA cloning of human allograft inflammatory factor-1: tissue distribution, cytokine induction, and mRNA expression in injured rat carotid arteries.
8912632|a|We have previously identified a partial cDNA fragment obtained from rat carotid arteries subject to balloon angioplasty which is increased in response to vascular injury. We now report the isolation and characterization of a full length human clone which is 98% homologous at the amino acid level to the rat. Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF-1), a gene previously reported to be expressed in rat IFN gamma-activated macrophages. This transcript is expressed in low levels in undamaged, and increases 1 day and 3 days, and declines 7 days post balloon angioplasty. This human AIF-1 homologue is inducible in serum and cytokine-stimulated human smooth muscle cells. Interestingly, human tissue distribution indicates a constitutive expression in lymphoid tissue which can be augmented by mitogens. In summary, human AIF represents a cytokine inducible, tissue-specific, and highly conserved transcript transiently expressed in response to vascular trauma.

8990205|t|Functional expression of a novel human neurokinin-3 receptor homolog that binds [3H]senktide and [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B, and is responsive to tachykinin peptide agonists.
8990205|a|In 1992, Xie et al. identified a cDNA sequence in the expression cloning search for the kappa opioid receptor. When the cDNA was expressed in Cos-7 cells, binding of opioid compounds was observed to be of low affinity and without kappa, mu, or delta selectivity [Xie, G.-X., Miyajima, A. and Goldstein, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 4124-4128]. This cDNA was highly homologous to the human neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptor sequence, and displayed lower homology to NK-1 and NK-2 sequences. This sequence was stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express neurokinin receptors naturally, and ligand binding and second messenger characteristics were compared with a human NK-3 receptor. The NK-3 receptor homolog bound [3H] senktide with a Kd of 39 nM, similar to that of the NK-3 receptor. The rank order of tachykinin peptides competing for [3H]senktide binding at the NK-3 receptor homolog was [MePhe7]neurokinin B > senktide > substance P = neurokinin A > neurokinin B. This cell line also bound [125I-MePhe7]neurokinin B; however, neurokinin B was an effective competitor. Tachykinin peptides stimulated both inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release at NK-3 and NK-3 receptor homolog cell lines, with similar rank orders of potency of [MePhe7] neurokinin B = neurokinin B = senktide > NKA = substance P. These results indicate that expression of the NK-3 receptor homolog cDNA in the Chinese hamster ovary cell system induces the expression of a receptor site with many similarities but certain key differences from that of the human NK-3 receptor. The results are discussed with reference to the existence of a novel human tachykinin receptor.

9022669|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of a transcription factor for the C-type natriuretic peptide gene promoter.
9022669|a|Our previous studies on the promoter function of the human C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) gene revealed the existence of two GC-rich cis elements essential for gene transcription in rat pituitary-derived GH3 cells. To isolate transcription factors that bind to those GC-rich elements, we screened a lambda ZAP cDNA library derived from GH3 cells by Southwestern screening. Several positive clones with specific binding abilities were obtained, and one was identical as TSC-22, a speculated transcriptional modulator stimulated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) of unknown function. TSC-22 significantly enhanced CNP promoter activity in GH3 cells. We further cloned a 1.8-kb full-length human TSC-22 cDNA from a fetal kidney cDNA library by a combination of polymerase chain reaction and the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends technique. In adults, human TSC-22 mRNA was highly expressed in brain, lung and heart. TSC-22 gene expression in GH3 and human aortic endothelial cells was stimulated by cytokines including TGF-beta, in correlation with the CNP mRNA increase. These results suggest that TSC-22 is a transcriptional regulator of the CNP gene and transmits signals from cytokines, such as TGF-beta, to CNP gene expression.

9027582|t|Isolation, characterization, and chromosomal mapping of a novel cDNA clone encoding human selenium binding protein.
9027582|a|We have isolated the full-length human 56 kDa selenium binding protein (hSP56) cDNA clone, which is the human homolog of mouse 56 kDa selenium binding protein. The cDNA is 1,668 bp long and has an open reading frame encoding 472 amino acids. The calculated molecular weight is 52.25 kDa and the estimated isoelectric point is 6.13. Using Northern blot hybridization, we found that this 56 kDa selenium binding protein is expressed in mouse heart with an intermediate level between those found in liver/lung/kidney and intestine. We have also successfully expressed hSP56 in Escherichia coli using the expression vector-pAED4. The hSP56 gene is located at human chromosome 1q21-22).

9092543|t|Cloning and chromosomal location of a novel member of the myotonic dystrophy family of protein kinases.
9092543|a|We have cloned a novel serine/threonine protein kinase (PK428) which is highly related (65%) within the kinase domain to the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DM-PK), as well as the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (33%). Northern blots demonstrate that PK428 mRNA is distributed widely among tissues and is expressed at the highest levels in pancreas, heart, and skeletal muscle, with lower levels in liver and lung. Two PK428 mRNAs 10 and 3.8 kilobase pairs in size are seen in a number of cell lines, including hematopoietic and breast cancer cells. An antibody generated to a glutathione S-transferase-PK428 fusion protein detects a 65-kDa protein in these cell lines, and a similarly sized protein when the cloned cDNA is transiently expressed in Cos 7 cells. Immunoprecipitation of the transiently expressed PK428 protein and incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP demonstrate that it is capable of autophosphorylation. In addition, immunoprecipitates of the PK428 protein kinase also phosphorylated histone H1 and a peptide encoding a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase substrate. The gene corresponding to the 3.8-kb PK428 mRNA, and its corresponding 65-kDa protein, was isolated by polymerase chain reaction screening of a P1 phage human genomic library. Using this P1 phage clone as a probe, the PK428 gene was located on 1q41-42, a possible location for a human senescence gene, a gene associated with Rippling muscle disease, as well as a region associated with genetically acquired mental retardation.

9092545|t|Isolation and characterization of a structural homologue of human PRK2 from rat liver. Distinguishing substrate and lipid activator specificities.
9092545|a|A homologue of human protein kinase C (PKC)-related kinase-2, PRK2, which had previously escaped identification in normal mammalian tissues, was isolated from rat liver as the protease-activated kinase (PAK) originally named PAK-2. The 130-kDa cytosolic enzyme was purified to homogeneity and shown by tryptic peptide and reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-amplified rat cDNA sequence analyses to be structurally related to the 116-kDa rat hepatic PAK-1/protein kinase N (PKN) and, even more closely (95% sequence identity) to the 130-kDa human PKC-related kinase, PRK2. Rat myeloma RNA was used as the RT-PCR template because of its relative abundance in PAK-2/PRK2 mRNA compared with liver and other rat tissues. The catalytic properties of PAK-2/PRK2 in many respects resembled those of hepatic PAK-1/PKN, but were distinguished by more favorable kinetics with several peptide substrates, and greater sensitivity to PKC pseudosubstrate and polybasic amino acid inhibitors. PAK-2/PRK2 was also activated by lipids, particularly cardiolipin and to a lesser extent by other acidic phospholipids and unsaturated fatty acids. Cardiolipin activation was most evident with autophosphorylation and histone H2B phosphorylation, but only marginally evident with the favored ribosomal S6-(229-239) peptide substrate for the protease-activated kinase activity. It was concluded that PAK-2 is the rat homologue of human PRK2, with biochemical properties distinct from although overlapping those of the PAK-1/PKN/PRK1 isoform.

9161407|t|Isolation of a full-length human WNT7A gene implicated in limb development and cell transformation, and mapping to chromosome 3p25.
9161407|a|The Wnt gene family has a role in development as well as tumourigenesis. One mouse member, Wnt7a, is vital for limb development in vivo and also possesses transforming ability in vitro. This study reports the isolation of a full length of human homologue of mouse Wnt7a gene by library screening. Yeast artificial chromosome-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (YAC-FISH) mapped the WNT7A gene to chromosome 3p25. Human WNT7A had an ORF encoding a deduced protein of 349 aa that exhibited 97% and 92% identity to mouse Wnt7a at the aa and nucleic acid levels, respectively. It possessed the 22 conserved cysteine residues and 3 more at the amino terminus, and a putative poly A tail. This is the fifth human WNT gene in which a complete cDNA sequence had been determined.

9215637|t|Coassembly of TRP and TRPL produces a distinct store-operated conductance.
9215637|a|The Drosophila retinal-specific protein, TRP (transient receptor potential), is the founding member of a family of store-operated channels (SOCs) conserved from C. elegans to humans. In vitro studies indicate that TRP is a SOC, but that the related retinal protein, TRPL, is constitutively active. In the current work, we report that coexpression of TRP and TRPL leads to a store-operated, outwardly rectifying current distinct from that owing to either TRP or TRPL alone. TRP and TRPL interact directly, indicating that the TRP-TRPL-dependent current is mediated by heteromultimeric association between the two subunits. We propose that the light-activated current in photoreceptor cells is produced by a combination of TRP homo- and TRP-TRPL heteromultimers.

9215685|t|A novel human serine-threonine phosphatase related to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene is selectively expressed in sensory neurons of neural crest origin.
9215685|a|Through our transcriptional mapping effort in the Xp22 region, we have isolated by exon trapping a new transcript highly homologous to the Drosophila retinal degeneration C (rdgC) gene. rdgC encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase protein and is required in Drosophila to prevent light-induced retinal degeneration. This human gene is the first mammalian member of the serine-threonine phosphatase with EF hand motif gene family, and was thus named PPEF (Protein Phosphatase with EF calcium-binding domain). The expression pattern of the mouse Ppef gene was studied by RNA in situ hybridization on embryonic tissue sections. While rdgC is expressed in the visual system of the fly, as well as in the mushroom bodies of the central brain, we found that Ppef is highly expressed in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and neural crest-derived cranial ganglia. The selective pattern of expression makes PPEF an important marker for sensory neuron differentiation and suggests a role for serine-threonine phosphatases in mammalian development.

9230439|t|A minK-HERG complex regulates the cardiac potassium current I(Kr).
9230439|a|MinK is a widely expressed protein of relative molecular mass approximately 15K that forms potassium channels by aggregation with other membrane proteins. MinK governs ion channel activation, regulation by second messengers, and the function and structure of the ion conduction pathway. Association of minK with a channel protein known as KvLQT1 produces a voltage-gated outward K+ current (I[sK]) resembling the slow cardiac repolarization current (I[Ks]). HERG, a human homologue of the ether-a-go-go gene of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, encodes a protein that produces the rapidly activating cardiac delayed rectifier (I[Kr]). These two potassium currents, I(Ks) and I(Kr), provide the principal repolarizing currents in cardiac myocytes for the termination of action potentials. Although heterologously expressed HERG channels are largely indistinguishable from native cardiac I(Kr), a role for minK in this current is suggested by the diminished I(Kr) in an atrial tumour line subjected to minK antisense suppression. Here we show that HERG and minK form a stable complex, and that this heteromultimerization regulates I(Kr) activity. MinK, through the formation of heteromeric channel complexes, is thus central to the control of the heart rate and rhythm.

9259282|t|PHOG, a candidate gene for involvement in the short stature of Turner syndrome.
9259282|a|The abnormalities seen in Turner syndrome (monosomy X) presumably result from haploinsufficiency of certain genes on the X chromosome. Gene dosage considerations lead to the prediction that the culpable genes escape X inactivation and have functional homologs on the Y chromosome. Among the genes with these characteristics are those residing in the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) of the sex chromosomes. A pseudoautosomal location for a dosage-sensitive locus involved in stature has been suggested based on the analyses of patients with deletions of a specific segment of the short arm PAR; hemizygosity for this putative locus probably also contributes to the short stature in Turner individuals. We have isolated a gene from the critical deleted region that encodes a novel homeodomain-containing transcription factor and is expressed at highest levels in osteogenic cells. We have named the gene PHOG, for pseudoautosomal homeobox-containing osteogenic gene. Its deletion in patients with short stature, the predicted altered dosage in 45,X individuals, along with the nature of the encoded protein and its expression pattern, make PHOG an attractive candidate for involvement in the short stature of Turner syndrome. We have also found that the mouse homolog of PHOG is autosomal, which may help to explain the lack of a growth abnormality in mice with monosomy X.

9346895|t|Glycogenin-2, a novel self-glucosylating protein involved in liver glycogen biosynthesis.
9346895|a|Glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein involved in the initiation phase of glycogen biosynthesis. A single mammalian gene had been reported to account for glycogen biogenesis in liver and muscle, the two major repositories of glycogen. We describe the characterization of novel forms of glycogenin, designated glycogenin-2 (GN-2), encoded by a second gene that is expressed preferentially in certain tissues, including liver, heart, and pancreas. Cloning of cDNAs encoding glycogenin-2 indicated the existence of multiple species, including three liver forms (GN-2alpha, GN-2beta, and GN-2gamma) generated in part by alternative splicing. Overall, GN-2 has 40-45% identity to muscle glycogenin but is 72% identical over a 200-residue segment thought to contain the catalytic domain. GN-2 expressed in Escherichia coli or COS cells is active in self-glucosylation assays, and self-glucosylated GN-2 can be elongated by skeletal muscle glycogen synthase. Antibodies raised against GN-2 produced in E. coli recognized proteins of Mr approximately 66,000 present in extracts of rat liver and in cultured H4IIEC3 hepatoma cells. In H4IIEC3 cells, most of the GN-2 was present as a free protein but some was covalently associated with glycogen fractions and was only released by treatment with alpha-amylase. H4IIEC3 cells also expressed the muscle form of glycogenin (glycogenin-1), which was attached to a chromatographically separable glycogen fraction.

9380751|t|hSK4, a member of a novel subfamily of calcium-activated potassium channels.
9380751|a|The gene for hSK4, a novel human small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, or SK channel, has been identified and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In physiological saline hSK4 generates a conductance of approximately 12 pS, a value in close agreement with that of other cloned SK channels. Like other members of this family, the polypeptide encoded by hSK4 contains a previously unnoted leucine zipper-like domain in its C terminus of unknown function. hSK4 appears unique, however, in its very high affinity for Ca2+ (EC50 of 95 nM) and its predominant expression in nonexcitable tissues of adult animals. Together with the relatively low homology of hSK4 to other SK channel polypeptides (approximately 40% identical), these data suggest that hSK4 belongs to a novel subfamily of SK channels.

9410898|t|Human pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with a defect in GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain expression.
9410898|a|Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a heterogeneous disorder of genetic or acquired etiologies. In some cases congenital PAP is associated with hereditary surfactant protein (SP)-B deficiency. To date, the molecular defect in the majority of patients with PAP has not been identified. In mice, PAP has been generated by targeted deletion of the genes for either the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta chain (beta c) or GM-CSF. Here, we describe an expression defect of beta c in three of seven pediatric patients with PAP and in one patient with severe lung disease suspected to be PAP. The patients failed to express normal levels of beta c as shown by flow cytometry. Strikingly reduced or absent function of beta c was demonstrated by ligand binding studies and progenitor clonogenic assays. Analysis of beta c DNA revealed a point mutation from proline to threonine at codon 602 in one patient. Our findings provide evidence that a defect in the expression of a hematopoietic cytokine receptor is associated with human PAP.

9480843|t|Triplet repeat-containing ribosomal protein L14 gene in immortalized human endothelial cell line (t-HUE4).
9480843|a|A cDNA encoding human 60S ribosomal subunit protein L14 (hRL14) was isolated from a human immortal endothelial cell line, t-HUE4. This cell line was established via a series of cell lines cultured in a serum-free and a protein-free medium, and a directional cDNA library has been constructed and screened in search for the genes modulating protein synthesis machinery in cell proliferation. A putative full-length clone with an open reading frame of 220 amino acids; predicted molecular weight of 23.6 kDa. A significant identity for hRL14 was observed with rat RL14 (85% identity), with exception of COOH-terminal region, but not with any eukaryote amino acid sequences so far deposited to database. The typical features of ribosomal proteins were observed in hRL14, as seen in nuclear targeting sequences necessary for the transport from cytoplasm to nucleolus, a bZIP like (basic region-leucine zipper) element for the binding to rRNA, and the internal repeat sequences; the pentapeptide QKA(A/S)X. The COOH-terminal region of the transcripts contained fifteen triplet repeats (GCT; alanine) at nucleotide 465 to 509, which is significantly expanded compared to the rat RL14. However, the repeat number was all the same among the normal human endothelial cell line and the cell lines established in the course of t-HUE4 establishment. A single band with about 800 bases was identified by Northern blot analysis without tissue specificity. This GCT repeat was found to be one of the longest uninterrupted repeats in a coding sequence, which were associated with the highest degree of polymorphism.

9480844|t|Molecular cloning of human D-dopachrome tautomerase cDNA: N-terminal proline is essential for enzyme activation.
9480844|a|D-Dopachrome tautomerase converts 2-carboxy-2,3-dihydroindole-5,6-quinone (D-dopachrome) into 5,6-dihydroxyindole. This protein has an amino acid sequence that is highly homologous with that of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which has the potential to catalyze D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid and is an important cytokine for T-lymphocyte activation. We isolated and sequenced a 566 bp-long cDNA encoding human D-dopachrome tautomerase. The cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding 118 amino acids, including the initiator methionine. The amino acid sequence of the protein shares 80% homology with that of the rat enzyme. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that mRNA of D-dopachrome tautomerase is expressed in a large amount in the liver, and to lesser extent in other organs, including the heart, lung and pancreas. After purification of D-dopachrome tautomerase expressed in E. coli, we confirmed that the recombinant protein catalyzes the conversion of D-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole. Its catalytic mechanism is not well understood. We found that the protein completely lost the enzyme activity when the N-terminal proline residue was replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. This fact suggests that the N-terminal proline is essential for the catalytic mechanism. Although the precise pathophysiological function of D-dopachrome tautomerase remains to be elucidated, the present results could contribute to further understanding of isomerase activity in relation to the immune response.

9480859|t|Isolation of full-length cDNA of mouse PAX4 gene and identification of its human homologue.
9480859|a|Recent genetic studies have suggested that PAX4, a member of the paired box (PAX) gene family, is involved in the mechanism regulating the fate of pancreatic islet endocrine progenitor cells. Murine PAX4 was originally identified by genomic screening and, to date, only a partial sequence of PAX4 has been reported. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of mouse PAX4 by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using RNA from MIN6 cells, a mouse insulinoma cell line. The full length of cDNA was 1.38 kb, consistent with the estimated size of the transcript by Northern blot. The deduced mouse PAX4 protein was 349 amino acids and had the predicted molecular weight of 38 kDa. Two DNA binding motifs, a 128-amino acid paired domain and a 61-amino acid paired-type homeodomain exhibit the highest amino acid homology with PAX6 (71.2%, 65.0%, respectively), another member of the PAX gene family. However, the sequence of the C-terminal segment of PAX4 diverged and showed no significant homology with any other known PAX genes. As to the genomic DNA, the coding region of the mouse PAX4 gene spanned approximately 5.5 kb and was composed of 10 exons. In the public DNA database, a human cosmid (g1572c264), which was localized on human chromosome 7q31.3, was found to contain a gene homologous to PAX4. The nucleotide and protein sequence homologies between mouse PAX4 and its human homologue were 83.1% and 80.0%, respectively. Interestingly, the ARP5 (ADP-ribosylation factor 5) gene was also found in the same cosmid g1572c264, suggesting the ARP5 gene to be adjacent to the human PAX4 homologue. The human cosmid g1572c264 contains at least four SSRPs (simple sequence repeat polymorphism), which could be used for genetic linkage studies of the locus. The results of this study, i.e. isolation of the full-length cDNA sequence of PAX4 and identification of the homologous human gene, will facilitate further functional and genetic studies of the PAX4 gene.

9480897|t|Identification of cDNAs encoding two human alpha class glutathione transferases (GSTA3 and GSTA4) and the heterologous expression of GSTA4-4.
9480897|a|The Expressed Sequence Tag database has been searched for examples of previously undescribed human Alpha class glutathione transferases. An incomplete transcript of the previously described GSTA3 gene was identified in a cDNA library derived from 8-9 week placenta. This indicates that the GSTA3 gene is functional and is possibly under specific developmental regulation. A second cDNA, termed GSTA4, was identified in a brain cDNA library. The encoded GSTA4-4 enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and was found to be immunologically distinct from GSTA1-1 and to have high activity with alk-2-enals. Although GSTA4-4 appears to be functionally similar to the mouse GST5.7 and rat GST8-8 Alpha class enzymes, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis suggest that GSTA4-4 may be a member of a distinct Alpha class subgroup.

9662397|t|BRCA1 protein is linked to the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex via RNA helicase A.
9662397|a|The breast cancer specific tumour suppressor protein, BRCA1 (refs 1,2), activates transcription when linked with a DNA-binding domain and is a component of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) holoenzyme. We show here that RNA helicase A (RHA) protein links BRCA1 to the holoenzyme complex. The region of BRCA1 which interacts with RHA and, thus, the holoenzyme complex, corresponds to subregions of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 (ref. 9). This interaction was shown to occur in yeast nuclei, and expression in human cells of a truncated RHA molecule which retains binding to BRCA1 inhibited transcriptional activation mediated by the BRCA1 carboxy terminus. These data are the first to identify a specific protein interaction with the BRCA1 C-terminal domain and are consistent with the model that BRCA1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator.

9766636|t|The IFN-inducible nucleoprotein IFI 16 is expressed in cells of the monocyte lineage, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated in other myeloid precursor populations.
9766636|a|IFI 16 is an interferon-inducible nucleoprotein expressed by human monocytes. IFI 16 and a related mouse protein, p202, control cellular proliferation by binding and modulating the functions of cell cycle regulatory factors including p53 and the retinoblastoma gene product, pRb. In this study, we examined IFI 16 expression in myeloid precursor cells cultured in vitro in colony-forming assays using granulocyte (G-) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM-) colony-stimulating factor (CSF). IFI 16 was expressed in 100% of CD34+ cells isolated from human bone marrow. When the CD34+ cells were induced to differentiate, two sub-populations of cells were identified by two-color cytofluorography: the CD14+ (monocytoid) cells all expressed IFI 16, whereas the CD14- (polymorphonuclear precursor) cells did not. The strongest expression of IFI 16 was in the cells staining brightest for CD14, whereas depletion of CD14+ monocytoid cells from mixed monocytic/granulocytic cultures largely abolished IFI 16-stained cells. Furthermore, in eight independent colony-forming assays, the number of IFI 16+ cells correlated closely with the numbers of monocyte precursors identified morphologically (R2 = 0.99), but was unrelated to the numbers of myelocytes, promyelocytes, and metamyelocytes; nor was IFI 16 expressed by erythroid or eosinophil precursors. We conclude that IFI 16 is expressed in CD34+ and monocytoid daughter cells, but is rapidly and markedly down-regulated at the corresponding stages of polymorphonuclear and erythroid development. This differential expression of IFI 16 in myeloid precursor subpopulations and its perceived molecular properties are consistent with a possible role in regulating myelopoiesis.

9930991|t|Overexpression and functional characterization of kinin receptors reveal subtype-specific phosphorylation.
9930991|a|G protein-coupled receptors such as the receptors for bradykinin are present in low copy numbers in most natural cells. To overcome the problems associated with the analysis of these receptors at the protein level, we used highly efficient expression systems such as the baculovirus/insect cell system. However, the structural and functional statuses of recombinant receptors have often remained elusive. We have expressed the two types of human kinin receptors, B1 and B2, in Sf9 cells. Both receptors are found on the surface of infected cells where they display the same pharmacological profiles as their cognate receptors of native cells. The functional analysis of kinin receptors coupled to the intracellular signaling pathways of Sf9 cells revealed differential patterns of ligand-induced phosphorylation for the two kinin receptors. The B1 receptor failed to undergo ligand-induced phosphorylation. However the B2 receptor showed selective phosphorylation of a minor 38 kDa band and lack of phosphorylation of a dominant 33 kDa band, indicating that only a fraction of the receptor protein is functionally linked to the kinase pathway. A striking discrepancy between the number of binding sites and the amount of receptor protein per cell (molar ratio of 1:20 to 1:1000) indicated that a significant portion of kinin receptors is associated with the intracellular compartments of Sf9 cells. Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the heterogeneity of recombinant receptors is not due to proteolytic processing but likely reflects incomplete or lacking N-glycosylation. We conclude that the baculovirus/Sf9 system is suitable for the recombinant expression and functional analysis of kinin receptors though limitations of the system have to be considered.

9931460|t|Isolation of hMRE11B: failure to complement yeast mre11 defects due to species-specific protein interactions.
9931460|a|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MRE11 gene plays an important role in meiotic recombination, mitotic DNA repair and telomere maintenance. We present the isolation of hMRE11B cDNA from a human HeLa cell cDNA library as an MRE11 homolog. Compared to the previously identified hMRE11, hMRE11B contains an additional 84bp sequence that results in a 28 amino-acid insertion close to the C-terminus. The expression pattern of hMRE11B in different tissues shows the presence of two mRNA species of approx. 2.6 and 7.5kb. Overexpression of hMRE11B does not complement the alkylation sensitivity of the mre11 null and temperature-sensitive mutant strains. In this study, we examine factors that may explain this lack of complementation. First, both Northern and Western analyses rule out the lack of hMRE11B transcription and/or translation in yeast. Second, we demonstrate that hMre11B, like the yeast Mre11 protein, dimerizes in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid system. This dimerization requires the C-terminal one-third of hMre11B protein, which includes the 28 amino acids absent in hMre11. However, hMre11B does not interact with Mre11, Rad50 and Xrs2. Hence, the lack of protein-protein interaction between hMre11B and the yeast Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2 may explain the inability of hMRE11B to complement the yeast mre11 mutants. We rule out the hypothesis that the lack of interaction and, in turn of complementation, is due to the absence of sequence homology at the C-terminal domain of hMre11B compared to the yeast Mre11. Instead, we propose that the C-terminus of hMre11B participates in protein-protein interaction and functions in a species-specific manner.

9931490|t|XCE, a new member of the endothelin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase family, is preferentially expressed in the CNS.
9931490|a|In the present study, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel member of the family of zinc metallopeptidases that includes neutral endopeptidase and endothelin-converting enzyme. The predicted amino-acid sequence of this enzyme, termed XCE, consists of 775 amino-acids with a single putative membrane-spanning region, an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 59 residues, and a large luminal domain that contains a characteristic zinc-binding motif. Western blot analysis of cells stably expressing this new metallopeptidase revealed a glycosylated protein of approximately 95 kDa. XCE mRNA was found to be predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, sympathetic ganglia and in uterine subepithelial cells. In the rat and human CNS, a very specific pattern of neuronal labelling (in presumptive cholinergic interneurons of basal ganglia, basal forebrain neurons, as well as brainstem and spinal cord motoneurons) was detected by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The enzyme substrate, as yet unidentified, might be found among the numerous neuropeptide transmitters which are colocalized with acetylcholine in these neurons.

11875050|t|Mutations in the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IMPDH1) cause the RP10 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.
11875050|a|Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is a heterogeneous set of progressive retinopathies caused by several distinct genes. One locus, the RP10 form of adRP, maps to human chromosome 7q31.1 and may account for 5-10% of adRP cases among Americans and Europeans. We identified two American families with the RP10 form of adRP by linkage mapping and used these families to reduce the linkage interval to 3.45 Mb between the flanking markers D7S686 and RP-STR8. Sequence and transcript analysis identified 54 independent genes within this region, at least 10 of which are retinal-expressed and thus candidates for the RP10 gene. A screen of retinal transcripts comparing retinas from normal mice to retinas from crx-/crx- knockout mice (with poorly differentiated photoreceptors) demonstrated a 6-fold reduction in one candidate, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1; EC 1.1.1.205). Since many of the genes known to cause retinitis pigmentosa are under CRX control in photoreceptors, IMPDH1 became a high-priority candidate for mutation screening. DNA sequencing of affected individuals from the two American RP10 families revealed a GAC-->AAC transition in codon 226 substituting an asparagine for an aspartic acid in both families. The identical mutation was also found in a British RP10 family. The Asp226Asn missense mutation is present in all affected individuals tested and absent from unaffected controls. The aspartic acid at codon 226 is conserved in all IMPDH genes, in all species examined, including bacteria, suggesting that this mutation is highly deleterious. Subsequent screening of probands from 60 other adRP families revealed an additional family with this mutation, confirming its association with retinitis pigmentosa and the relatively high frequency of this mutation. Another IMPDH1 substitution, Val268Ile, was also observed in this cohort of patients but not in controls. IMPDH1 is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, functioning as a homotetramer, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. As such, it plays an important role in cyclic nucleoside metabolism within photoreceptors. Several classes of drugs are known to affect IMPDH isoenzymes, including nucleotide and NAD analogs, suggesting that small-molecule therapy may be available, one day, for RP10 patients.

15480879|t|Alternative splicing in the N-terminus of Alzheimer's presenilin 1.
15480879|a|Presenilin 1 (PS1) is mutated in the majority of familial cases of Alzheimer disease (AD). Although it is clear that PS1 is involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the exact function of PS1 is still elusive. Human presenilin 1 (PS1) is alternatively spliced, resulting in the presence or absence of a four-amino acid motif, VRSQ, in the PS1 N-terminus. In human tissues, both isoforms are expressed. Here we report that mouse and rat only express the longer PS1 isoform. The presence of this motif introduces a potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C. Because the splice occurs in the region of PS1 that we have previously shown to bind to rabGDI, this might provide a regulatory mechanism for this interaction. Our data show that the -VRSQ isoform binds rabGDI, but the +VRSQ does not. Moreover, mutation of the putatively phosphorylated threonine in PS1 disrupts the binding to rabGDI, showing its importance for the interaction. To our knowledge this is the first study showing a functional difference between PS1 splice variants. The possible consequences for APP processing and the pathogenesis of AD are discussed.

17345627|t|Over-expression of BMP4 and BMP5 in a child with axial skeletal malformations and heterotopic ossification: a new syndrome.
17345627|a|Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a highly conserved class of signaling molecules that induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation in vivo. Dysregulated expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is found in the cells of patients who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a genetic disorder of axial and appendicular skeletal malformation and progressive heterotopic ossification. Loss of function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein 5 (bmp5) gene leading to under-expression of BMP5 cause the murine short ear syndrome, characterized by small malformed ears and a broad range of axial skeletal malformations. We found features reminiscent of both the short ear mouse and FOP in a child with malformed external ears, multiple malformations of the axial skeleton, and progressive heterotopic ossification in the neck and back. We examined BMP mRNA expression in transformed lymphocytes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression by ELISA assays and immunohistochemistry. Elevated levels of BMP4 and BMP5 mRNA and protein were detected in the patient's cells while levels of BMP2 mRNA were unchanged. Our data suggest that dysregulated expression of BMP4 and BMP5 genes is associated with an array of human axial skeletal abnormalities similar to the short ear mouse and FOP.

18772193|t|Novel suppressors of alpha-synuclein toxicity identified using yeast.
18772193|a|The mechanism by which the Parkinson's disease-related protein alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) causes neurodegeneration has not been elucidated. To determine the genes that protect cells from alpha-syn, we used a genetic screen to identify suppressors of the super sensitivity of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing alpha-syn to killing by hydrogen peroxide. Forty genes in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism, protein biosynthesis, vesicle trafficking and the response to stress were identified. Five of the forty genes--ENT3, IDP3, JEM1, ARG2 and HSP82--ranked highest in their ability to block alpha-syn-induced reactive oxygen species accumulation, and these five genes were characterized in more detail. The deletion of any of these five genes enhanced the toxicity of alpha-syn as judged by growth defects compared with wild-type cells expressing alpha-syn, which indicates that these genes protect cells from alpha-syn. Strikingly, four of the five genes are specific for alpha-syn in that they fail to protect cells from the toxicity of the two inherited mutants A30P or A53T. This finding suggests that alpha-syn causes toxicity to cells through a different pathway than these two inherited mutants. Lastly, overexpression of Ent3p, which is a clathrin adapter protein involved in protein transport between the Golgi and the vacuole, causes alpha-syn to redistribute from the plasma membrane into cytoplasmic vesicular structures. Our interpretation is that Ent3p mediates the transport of alpha-syn to the vacuole for proteolytic degradation. A similar clathrin adaptor protein, epsinR, exists in humans.

18805828|t|Association of a null allele of SPRN with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
18805828|a|BACKGROUND: No susceptibility genes have been identified in human prion disase, apart from the prion protein gene (PRNP). The gene SPRN, encodes Shadoo (Sho, shadow of prion protein) which has protein homology and possible functional links with the prion protein. METHODS: A genetic screen was carried out of the open reading frame of SPRN by direct sequencing in 522 patients with prion disease, including 107 with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), and 861 healthy controls. RESULTS: A common coding variant of SPRN, two further single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three rare insertion or deletion variants were found. A single base-pair insertion at codon 46, predicted to cause a frameshift and potentially a novel protein, was found in two patients with vCJD but not in controls (p = 0.01). Two linked SNPs, one in intron 1 and the other a missense variant at codon 7, were associated with risk of sporadic CJD (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: These data justify the functional genetic characterisation of SPRN and support the involvement of Shadoo in prion pathobiology.

19104841|t|Alterations of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 loci in early dysplastic lesions of head and neck: clinical and prognostic implications.
19104841|a|Deletion of chromosomal 3p12.3 was suggested to be associated with dysplastic lesions of head and neck. This region harbors two candidate tumor suppressors ROBO1/DUTT1, ROBO2 and two non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) located at intron 2 of ROBO1/DUTT1. Aim of this study is to understand the role of these genes in development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A collection of 72 dysplastic lesions and 116 HNSCC samples and two oral cancer cell lines were analyzed for ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 deletion and promoter methylation. ROBO1/DUTT1, ROBO2 and two ncRNAs mRNA expression were analyzed by Q-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 was performed. Alterations of these genes were correlated with different clinicopathological parameters. High frequency of molecular alterations (deletion/methylation) was seen in ROBO1/DUTT1 than ROBO2. In mild dysplastic lesions both of these genes showed high molecular alterations and remained more or less constant in subsequent stages. Q-PCR analysis showed reduced expression of these genes and the two ncRNAs. In vitro demethylation experiment by 5-aza-dC showed upregulation of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 while the expression of the ncRNAs remained unchanged. Immunohistochemical analysis of ROBO1/DUTT1 and ROBO2 showed concordance with their mRNA expression and molecular alterations. Poor patients' outcome was predicted in the cases with alteration of ROBO1/DUTT1 along with tobacco addiction and nodal involvement. Our data suggests (a) ROBO1/DUTT1 and the ncRNAs are transcribed from different promoters, and (b) inactivation of ROBO1/DUTT1 could be used as molecular signature for early detection and prognosis of the head and neck cancer.

20691404|t|Loss of corneodesmosin leads to severe skin barrier defect, pruritus, and atopy: unraveling the peeling skin disease.
20691404|a|Generalized peeling skin disease is an autosomal-recessive ichthyosiform erythroderma characterized by lifelong patchy peeling of the skin. After genome-wide linkage analysis, we have identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in CDSN in a large consanguineous family with generalized peeling skin, pruritus, and food allergies, which leads to a complete loss of corneodesmosin. In contrast to hypotrichosis simplex, which can be associated with specific dominant CDSN mutations, peeling skin disease is characterized by a complete loss of CDSN expression. The skin phenotype is consistent with a recent murine Cdsn knockout model. Using three-dimensional human skin models, we demonstrate that lack of corneodesmosin causes an epidermal barrier defect supposed to account for the predisposition to atopic diseases, and we confirm the role of corneodesmosin as a decisive epidermal adhesion molecule. Therefore, peeling skin disease will represent a new model disorder for atopic diseases, similarly to Netherton syndrome and ichthyosis vulgaris in the recent past.

10072769|t|Selection of cDNAs encoding putative type II membrane proteins on the cell surface from a human full-length cDNA bank.
10072769|a|We have developed a simple method to test whether a hydrophobic segment near the N-terminus of a protein functions as a type II signal anchor (SA) in which the N-terminus faces the cytoplasm. A cDNA fragment containing the putative SA sequence of a target clone was fused in-frame to the 5' end of a cDNA fragment encoding the protease domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). The resulting fused gene was expressed in COS7 cells. Fibrinolytic activity on the cell surface was measured by placing a fibrin sheet in contact with the transfected COS7 cells after removing the medium. When the cDNA fragment encoded a SA, the fibrin sheet was lysed by the u-PA expressed on the cell surface. The fibrinolytic activity was not detected in the culture medium, suggesting that the u-PA remains on the cell surface anchored via the SA in the membrane without being cleaved by signal peptidase. This fibrin sheet method was successfully applied to select five novel cDNA clones encoding putative type II membrane proteins from a human full-length cDNA bank.

10092817|t|C1qRP is a heavily O-glycosylated cell surface protein involved in the regulation of phagocytic activity.
10092817|a|C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) interact with human monocytes and macrophages, resulting in the enhancement of phagocytosis of suboptimally opsonized targets. mAbs that recognize a cell surface molecule of 126,000 Mr, designated C1qRP, have been shown to inhibit C1q- and MBL-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis. Similar inhibition of the SPA-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis by these mAbs now suggests that C1qRP is a common component of a receptor for these macromolecules. Ligation of human monocytes with immobilized R3, a IgM mAb recognizing C1qRP, also triggers enhanced phagocytic capacity of these cells in the absence of ligand, verifying the direct involvement of this polypeptide in the regulation of phagocytosis. While the cDNA for C1qRP encodes a 631 amino acid membrane protein, Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the cDNA of the C1qRP coding region express a surface glycoprotein with the identical 126,000 Mr in SDS-PAGE as the native C1qRP. Use of glycosylation inhibitors, cleavage of the mature C1qRP with specific glycosidases, and in vitro translation of C1qRP cDNA demonstrated that both posttranslational glycosylation and the nature of the amino acid sequence of the protein contribute to the difference between its predicted m.w. and its migration on SDS-PAGE. These results verify that the cDNA cloned codes for the mature C1qRP, that C1qRP contains a relatively high degree of O-linked glycoslyation, and that C1qRP cross-linked directly by monoclonal anti-C1qRP or engaged as a result of cell surface ligation of SPA, as well as C1q and MBL, enhances phagocytosis.

10192385|t|A mutation in OTOF, encoding otoferlin, a FER-1-like protein, causes DFNB9, a nonsyndromic form of deafness.
10192385|a|Using a candidate gene approach, we identified a novel human gene, OTOF, underlying an autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic prelingual deafness, DFNB9. The same nonsense mutation was detected in four unrelated affected families of Lebanese origin. OTOF is the second member of a mammalian gene family related to Caenorhabditis elegans fer-1. It encodes a predicted cytosolic protein (of 1,230 aa) with three C2 domains and a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain. The sequence homologies and predicted structure of otoferlin, the protein encoded by OTOF, suggest its involvement in vesicle membrane fusion. In the inner ear, the expression of the orthologous mouse gene, mainly in the sensory hair cells, indicates that such a role could apply to synaptic vesicles.

10197527|t|Slit2-Mediated chemorepulsion and collapse of developing forebrain axons.
10197527|a|Diffusible chemorepellents play a major role in guiding developing axons toward their correct targets by preventing them from entering or steering them away from certain regions. Genetic studies in Drosophila revealed a novel repulsive guidance system that prevents inappropriate axons from crossing the CNS midline; this repulsive system is mediated by the Roundabout (Robo) receptor and its secreted ligand Slit. In rodents, Robo and Slit are expressed in the spinal cord and Slit can repel spinal motor axons in vitro. Here, we extend these findings into higher brain centers by showing that Robo1 and Robo2, as well as Slit1 and Slit2, are often expressed in complementary patterns in the developing forebrain. Furthermore, we show that human Slit2 can repel olfactory and hippocampal axons and collapse their growth cones.

10381257|t|Metaxin 1 interacts with metaxin 2, a novel related protein associated with the mammalian mitochondrial outer membrane.
10381257|a|A recently described protein, metaxin 1, serves as a component of a preprotein import complex in the outer membrane of the mammalian mitochondrion. A yeast two-hybrid screen with metaxin 1 as bait has now identified a novel protein, which we have termed metaxin 2, as a metaxin 1-binding protein. Metaxin 2 shares 29% identity with metaxin 1 at the amino acid level, but metaxin 2, unlike metaxin 1, lacks a C-terminal mitochondrial outer membrane signal-anchor domain. Two C. elegans hypothetical proteins, CelZC97.1 and CelF39B2.i, share high sequence similarity with metaxin 2 and metaxin 1, respectively, and likely represent the C. elegans orthologs. Affinity-purified antibodies against metaxin 2 were prepared against the recombinant protein produced in E. coli and were used to analyze the subcellular distribution of metaxin 2. In subcellular fractions of mouse liver, a 29 kD immunoreactive protein, consistent in size with the predicted translation product of metaxin 2 cDNA, was found solely in mitochondria. Alkali extraction of mitochondria indicated that metaxin 2 is peripherally associated with mitochondrial membranes. Metaxin 2 in intact mitochondria was susceptible to digestion with proteinase K, indicating that metaxin 2 is located on the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Finally, baculoviruses encoding a His6-tagged metaxin 2 and an untagged metaxin 1 lacking its C-terminal transmembrane domain were produced and used separately or in combination to infect Sf21 insect cells. Metaxin 1 bound to a Ni2+-chelate affinity column only in the presence of metaxin 2, indicating that metaxin 1 and metaxin 2 interact when overexpressed in insect cells. These results suggest that metaxin 2 is bound to the cytosolic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane by means of its interaction with membrane-bound metaxin 1, and that this complex may play a role in protein import into mammalian mitochondria.

10409432|t|Comparative analysis of a novel gene from the Wolf-Hirschhorn/Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome critical region.
10409432|a|Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by mental and developmental defects resulting from the absence of a segment of one chromosome 4 short arm (4p16.3). Recently, Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome (PRDS), which is also due to a deletion of chromosome 4p16.3, has been shown to be allelic to WHS. Due to the complex and variable expression of these disorders, it is thought that WHS/PRDS results from a segmental aneusomy of 4p resulting in haploinsufficieny of an undefined number of genes that contribute to the phenotype. In an effort to identify genes that contribute to human development and whose absence may contribute to the phenotype associated with these syndromes, we have generated a transcript map of the 165-kb critical region and have identified a number of potential genes. One of these genes, WHSC2, which was identified with the IMAGE cDNA clone 53283, has been characterized. Sequence analysis defined an open reading frame of 1584 bp (528 amino acids), and transcript analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript in all fetal and adult tissues tested. In parallel, the mouse homologue was isolated and characterized. Mouse sequence analysis and the pattern of expression are consistent with the clone being the murine equivalent of the human WHSC2 gene (designated Whsc2h). The data from sequence and transcript analysis of this new human gene in combination with the lack of significant similarity to proteins of known function imply that it represents a novel gene. Most importantly, its location within the WHSCR suggests that this gene may play a role in the phenotype of the Wolf-Hirschhorn/Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome.   Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

10455115|t|Redox regulation of cell signaling by selenocysteine in mammalian thioredoxin reductases.
10455115|a|The intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, together with the thioredoxin and glutathione systems, is thought to participate in redox signaling in mammalian cells. The activity of thioredoxin is dependent on the redox status of thioredoxin reductase (TR), the activity of which in turn is dependent on a selenocysteine residue. Two mammalian TR isozymes (TR2 and TR3), in addition to that previously characterized (TR1), have now been identified in humans and mice. All three TR isozymes contain a selenocysteine residue that is located in the penultimate position at the carboxyl terminus and which is encoded by a UGA codon. The generation of reactive oxygen species in a human carcinoma cell line was shown to result in both the oxidation of the selenocysteine in TR1 and a subsequent increase in the expression of this enzyme. These observations identify the carboxyl-terminal selenocysteine of TR1 as a cellular redox sensor and support an essential role for mammalian TR isozymes in redox-regulated cell signaling.

10491302|t|Identification of a Wnt-responsive signal transduction pathway in primary endothelial cells.
10491302|a|The beta-catenin signal transduction pathway, which can be activated by secreted Wnt proteins, plays a key role in normal embryonic development and in malignant transformation of the mammary gland and colon. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that Wnt and beta-catenin signaling also function in cells of the vasculature. RT-PCR analysis showed that primary endothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures, of both mouse and human origin, express members of the Wnt and Wnt receptor (Frizzled) gene families. Transfection of an expression vector for Wnt-1 into primary endothelial cells increased both the free pool of beta-catenin and the transcription from a Lef/tcf-dependent reporter gene construct. Expression of Wnt-1, but not Wnt-5a, also stimulated proliferation of primary endothelial cell cultures. These data show that Wnt and Frizzled proteins can regulate signal transduction, via beta-catenin, in endothelial cells. These findings suggest that Wnt signaling may feature in normal differentiation of the vasculature as well as in pathological settings where endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation is disturbed.

10531035|t|Identification of a family of human F-box proteins.
10531035|a|F-box proteins are an expanding family of eukaryotic proteins characterized by an approximately 40 aminoacid motif, the F box (so named because cyclin F was one of the first proteins in which this motif was identified) . Some F-box proteins have been shown to be critical for the controlled degradation of cellular regulatory proteins  . In fact, F-box proteins are one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligases called SCFs. The other three subunits are the Skp1 protein; one of the cullin proteins (Cul1 in metazoans and Cdc53 or Cul A in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae); and the recently identified Roc1 protein (also called Rbx1 or Hrt1). SCF ligases bring ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (either Ubc3 or Ubc4) to substrates that are specifically recruited by the different F-box proteins. The need for high substrate specificity and the large number of known F-box proteins in yeast and worms   suggest the existence of a large family of mammalian F-box proteins. Using Skp1 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen and by searching DNA databases, we identified a family of 26 human F-box proteins, 25 of which were novel. Some of these proteins contained WD-40 domains or leucine-rich repeats; others contained either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. We have named the F-box proteins that contain WD-40 domains Fbws, those containing leucine-rich repeats, Fbls, and the remaining ones Fbxs. We have further characterized representative members of these three classes of F-box proteins.

10534401|t|Cloning, characterization, and localization of mouse and human SPO11.
10534401|a|Spo11 is a meiosis-specific protein in yeast that has been found covalently bound to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during the early stages of meiosis. These DSBs initiate homologous recombination, which is required for proper segregation of chromosomes and the generation of genetic diversity during meiosis. Here we report the cloning, characterization, tissue expression, and chromosomal localization of both mouse and human homologues of Spo11. The putative mouse and human proteins are 82% identical and share approximately 25% identity with other family members. Northern blot analysis revealed testis-specific expression for both genes, but RT-PCR results showed ubiquitous expression of at least a portion of Spo11 in mouse. Human SPO11 was also detected in several somatic tissues. Mouse Spo11 was localized to chromosome 2H4, and human SPO11 was localized to chromosome 20q13.2-q13.3, a region amplified in some breast and ovarian tumors.

10578051|t|Purification, molecular cloning, and genomic organization of human brain long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase.
10578051|a|An acyl-CoA hydrolase, referred to as hBACH, was purified from human brain cytosol. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 100 kDa and 43-kDa subunits, and was highly active with long-chain acyl-CoAs, e.g. a maximal velocity of 295 micromol/min/mg and K(m) of 6.4 microM for palmitoyl-CoA. Acyl-CoAs with carbon chain lengths of C(8-18) were also good substrates. In human brain cytosol, 85% of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity was titrated by an anti-BACH antibody, which accounted for over 75% of the enzyme activity found in the brain tissue. The cDNA isolated for hBACH, when expressed in Escherichia coli, directed the expression of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity and a 44-kDa protein immunoreactive to the anti-BACH antibody, which in turn neutralized the hydrolase activity. The hBACH cDNA encoded a 338-amino acid sequence which was 95% identical to that of a rat homolog. The hBACH gene spanned about 130 kb and comprised 9 exons, and was mapped to 1p36.2 on the cytogenetic ideogram. These findings indicate that the long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase present in the brain is well conserved between man and the rat, suggesting a conserved role for this enzyme in the mammalian brain, and enabling genetic studies on the functional analysis of acyl-CoA hydrolase.

10588946|t|Family of human oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) homologues. A novel member implicated in brain sterol metabolism.
10588946|a|Oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) is a cytosolic protein that undergoes ligand-induced binding to the Golgi apparatus and has been implicated in the regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae an OSBP homologue is involved in membrane trafficking through the Golgi complex. Prompted by the multitude of OSBP-related genes in the yeast genome, we carried out a search for human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) displaying homology to the sterol-binding domain of OSBP. This revealed a minimum of six novel OSBP-related proteins, designated ORP-1 to ORP-6. ORP cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcription-PCR from human liver mRNA, and used for Northern blot analysis of human tissue transcript panels. This verified that each of them represents a different gene product and showed that they display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. The ORP-1 and -2 mRNA expression levels were similar to or higher than that of OSBP while the ORP-3 to -6 mRNAs were detected at lower levels in specific tissues. The most abundantly expressed new gene, ORP-1, was transcribed at strikingly high levels in the cortical areas of human brain and displayed sterol-regulated expression in a cultured human neuroblastoma cell line. This indicates that ORP-1 may play an important role in maintaining the sterol balance in cells of the central nervous system. Together with OSBP, the identified gene products constitute a novel human protein family that may provide a link between organellar sterol status and membrane dynamics.

10607832|t|Myoferlin, a candidate gene and potential modifier of muscular dystrophy.
10607832|a|Dysferlin, the gene product of the limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B locus, encodes a membrane-associated protein with homology to Caenorhabditis elegans fer-1. Humans with mutations in dysferlin ( DYSF ) develop muscle weakness that affects both proximal and distal muscles. Strikingly, the phenotype in LGMD 2B patients is highly variable, but the type of mutation in DYSF cannot explain this phenotypic variability. Through electronic database searching, we identified a protein highly homologous to dysferlin that we have named myoferlin. Myoferlin mRNA was highly expressed in cardiac muscle and to a lesser degree in skeletal muscle. However, antibodies raised to myoferlin showed abundant expression of myoferlin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. Within the cell, myoferlin was associated with the plasma membrane but, unlike dysferlin, myoferlin was also associated with the nuclear membrane. Ferlin family members contain C2 domains, and these domains play a role in calcium-mediated membrane fusion events. To investigate this, we studied the expression of myoferlin in the mdx mouse, which lacks dystrophin and whose muscles undergo repeated rounds of degeneration and regeneration. We found upregulation of myoferlin at the membrane in mdx skeletal muscle. Thus, myoferlin ( MYOF ) is a candidate gene for muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy, or possibly a modifier of the muscular dystrophy phenotype.

10619843|t|The VacA toxin of Helicobacter pylori identifies a new intermediate filament-interacting protein.
10619843|a|The VacA toxin produced by Helicobacter pylori acts inside cells and induces the formation of vacuoles arising from late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Using VacA as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell library, we have identified a novel protein of 54 kDa (VIP54), which interacts specifically with VacA, as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation and binding experiments. VIP54 is expressed in cultured cells and many tissues, with higher expression in the brain, muscle, kidney and liver. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-VIP54 affinity- purified antibodies shows a fibrous pattern typical of intermediate filaments. Double label immunofluorescence performed on various cell lines with antibodies specific to different intermediate filament proteins revealed that VIP54 largely co-distributes with vimentin. In contrast to known intermediate filament proteins, VIP54 is predicted to contain approximately 50% of helical segments, but no extended coiled-coil regions. The possible involvement of this novel protein in interactions between intermediate filaments and late endosomal compartments is discussed.

10647011|t|Chromosome instability and immunodeficiency syndrome caused by mutations in a DNA methyltransferase gene.
10647011|a|The recessive autosomal disorder known as ICF syndrome (for immunodeficiency, centromere instability and facial anomalies; Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 242860) is characterized by variable reductions in serum immunoglobulin levels which cause most ICF patients to succumb to infectious diseases before adulthood. Mild facial anomalies include hypertelorism, low-set ears, epicanthal folds and macroglossia. The cytogenetic abnormalities in lymphocytes are exuberant: juxtacentromeric heterochromatin is greatly elongated and thread-like in metaphase chromosomes, which is associated with the formation of complex multiradiate chromosomes. The same juxtacentromeric regions are subject to persistent interphase self-associations and are extruded into nuclear blebs or micronuclei. Abnormalities are largely confined to tracts of classical satellites 2 and 3 at juxtacentromeric regions of chromosomes 1, 9 and 16. Classical satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated at cytosine residues, but in ICF syndrome it is almost completely unmethylated in all tissues. ICF syndrome is the only genetic disorder known to involve constitutive abnormalities of genomic methylation patterns. Here we show that five unrelated ICF patients have mutations in both alleles of the gene that encodes DNA methyltransferase 3B (refs 5, 6). Cytosine methylation is essential for the organization and stabilization of a specific type of heterochromatin, and this methylation appears to be carried out by an enzyme specialized for the purpose.

10681536|t|Functional expression of the human hZIP2 zinc transporter.
10681536|a|Zinc is an essential nutrient for humans, yet we know little about how this metal ion is taken up by mammalian cells. In this report, we describe the characterization of hZip2, a human zinc transporter identified by its similarity to zinc transporters recently characterized in fungi and plants. hZip2 is a member of the ZIP family of eukaryotic metal ion transporters that includes two other human genes, hZIP1 and hZIP3, and genes in mice and rats. To test whether hZip2 is a zinc transporter, we examined (65)Zn uptake activity in transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing hZip2 from the CMV promoter. hZip2-expressing cells accumulated more zinc than control cells because of an increased initial zinc uptake rate. This activity was time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and saturable with an apparent K(m) of 3 microM. hZip2 zinc uptake activity was inhibited by several other transition metals, suggesting that this protein may transport other substrates as well. hZip2 activity was not energy-dependent, nor did it require K(+) or Na(+) gradients. Zinc uptake by hZip2 was stimulated by HCO(3)(-) treatment, suggesting a Zn(2+)-HCO(3)(-) cotransport mechanism. Finally, hZip2 was exclusively localized in the plasma membrane. These results indicate that hZip2 is a zinc transporter, and its identification provides one of the first molecular tools to study zinc uptake in mammalian cells.

10692449|t|Cloning and functional characterization of novel large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel beta subunits, hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4.
10692449|a|We present the cloning and characterization of two novel calcium-activated potassium channel beta subunits, hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4, that are enriched in the testis and brain, respectively. We compare and contrast the steady state and kinetic properties of these beta subunits with the previously cloned mouse beta1 (mKCNMB1) and the human beta2 subunit (hKCNMB2). Once inactivation is removed, we find that hKCNMB2 has properties similar to mKCNMB1. hKCNMB2 slows Hslo1 channel gating and shifts the current-voltage relationship to more negative potentials. hKCNMB3 and hKCNMB4 have distinct effects on slo currents not observed with mKCNMB1 and hKCNMB2. Although we found that hKCNMB3 does interact with Hslo channels, its effects on Hslo1 channel properties were slight, increasing Hslo1 activation rates. In contrast, hKCNMB4 slows Hslo1 gating kinetics, and modulates the apparent calcium sensitivity of Hslo1. We found that the different effects of the beta subunits on some Hslo1 channel properties are calcium-dependent. mKCNMB1 and hKCNMB2 slow activation at 1 microM but not at 10 microM free calcium concentrations. hKCNMB4 decreases Hslo1 channel openings at low calcium concentrations but increases channel openings at high calcium concentrations. These results suggest that beta subunits in diverse tissue types fine-tune slo channel properties to the needs of a particular cell.

10693807|t|Positional cloning of zebrafish ferroportin1 identifies a conserved vertebrate iron exporter.
10693807|a|Defects in iron absorption and utilization lead to iron deficiency and overload disorders. Adult mammals absorb iron through the duodenum, whereas embryos obtain iron through placental transport. Iron uptake from the intestinal lumen through the apical surface of polarized duodenal enterocytes is mediated by the divalent metal transporter, DMTi. A second transporter has been postulated to export iron across the basolateral surface to the circulation. Here we have used positional cloning to identify the gene responsible for the hypochromic anaemia of the zebrafish mutant weissherbst. The gene, ferroportin1, encodes a multiple-transmembrane domain protein, expressed in the yolk sac, that is a candidate for the elusive iron exporter. Zebrafish ferroportin1 is required for the transport of iron from maternally derived yolk stores to the circulation and functions as an iron exporter when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Human Ferroportin1 is found at the basal surface of placental syncytiotrophoblasts, suggesting that it also transports iron from mother to embryo. Mammalian Ferroportin1 is expressed at the basolateral surface of duodenal enterocytes and could export cellular iron into the circulation. We propose that Ferroportin1 function may be perturbed in mammalian disorders of iron deficiency or overload.

The cloned cDNA encodes a protein of 562 amino acids with a domain organization similar to that of other MT-MMPs, including a prodomain with a cysteine switch, a catalytic domain with the zinc-binding site, a hemopexin-like domain, and a COOH-terminal extension rich in hydrophobic residues. The predicted protein sequence also contains a short insertion of basic residues located between the propeptide and the catalytic domain and involved in the proteolytic activation of MT-MMPs by furin-like enzymes. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with the isolated cDNA revealed that the encoded protein is localized at the cell surface. Based on these properties, this novel human matrix metalloproteinase has been called MT6-MMP because it is the sixth identified member of this subfamily of matrix metalloproteinase. Cotransfection of expression plasmids encoding MT6-MMP and progelatinase A resulted in activation of COS-7-secreted progelatinase A, as demonstrated by gelatin zymography. In contrast, transfection of progelatinase A cDNA alone did not lead to the activation of the proenzyme. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNAs isolated from human tissues demonstrated that MT6-MMP is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, lung, and spleen. MT6-MMP was also detected at high levels in SW480 colon carcinoma cells as well as in some anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas, but not in normal colon or brain or in meningiomas. On the basis of these results, we propose that MT6-MMP may facilitate tumor progression through its ability to activate progelatinase A at the membrane of cells from colon carcinomas or brain tumors.

10716726|t|Large exons encoding multiple ectodomains are a characteristic feature of protocadherin genes.
10716726|a|Recent studies revealed a striking difference in the genomic organization of classic cadherin genes and one family of "nonclassic cadherin" genes designated protocadherins. Specifically, the DNA sequences encoding the ectodomain repeats of classic cadherins are interrupted by multiple introns. By contrast, all of the encoded ectodomains of each member of the protocadherin gene clusters are present in one large exon. To determine whether large ectodomain exons are a general feature of protocadherin genes we have investigated the genomic organization of several additional human protocadherin genes by using DNA sequence information in GenBank. These genes include protocadherin 12 (Pcdh12), an ortholog of the mouse vascular endothelial cadherin-2 gene; hFmi1 and hFmi2, homologs of the Drosophila planar cell polarity gene, flamingo; hFat2, a homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene fat; and the Drosophila DN-cadherin and DE-cadherin genes. Each of these genes was found to be a member of the protocadherin subfamily, based on amino acid sequence comparisons of their ectodomains. Remarkably, all of these protocadherin genes share a common feature: most of the genomic DNA sequences encoding their ectodomains are not interrupted by an intron. We conclude that the presence of unusually large exons is a characteristic feature of protocadherin genes.

10729163|t|Induction of a novel cellular homolog of interleukin-10, AK155, by transformation of T lymphocytes with herpesvirus saimiri.
10729163|a|Although herpesvirus saimiri-transformed T lymphocytes retain multiple normal T-cell functions, only a few changes have been described. By subtractive hybridization, we have isolated a novel cellular gene, ak155, a sequence homolog of the interleukin-10 gene. Specifically herpesvirus saimiri-transformed T cells overexpress ak155 and secrete the protein into the supernatant. In other T-cell lines and in native peripheral blood cells, but not in B cells, ak155 is transcribed at low levels. AK155 forms homodimers similarly to interleukin-10. As a lymphokine, AK155 may contribute to the transformed phenotype of human T cells after infection by herpesvirus saimiri.

10747949|t|A novel mammalian iron-regulated protein involved in intracellular iron metabolism.
10747949|a|We have isolated and characterized a novel iron-regulated gene that is homologous to the divalent metal transporter 1 family of metal transporters. This gene, termed metal transporter protein (mtp1), is expressed in tissues involved in body iron homeostasis including the developing and mature reticuloendothelial system, the duodenum, and the pregnant uterus. MTP1 is also expressed in muscle and central nervous system cells in the embryo. At the subcellular level, MTP1 is localized to the basolateral membrane of the duodenal epithelial cell and a cytoplasmic compartment of reticuloendothelial system cells. Overexpression of MTP1 in tissue culture cells results in intracellular iron depletion. In the adult mouse, MTP1 expression in the liver and duodenum are reciprocally regulated. Iron deficiency induces MTP1 expression in the duodenum but down-regulates expression in the liver. These data indicate that MTP1 is an iron-regulated membrane-spanning protein that is involved in intracellular iron metabolism.

10748049|t|Characterization of ABCB9, an ATP binding cassette protein associated with lysosomes.
10748049|a|We have cloned full-length human and mouse cDNAs of ABCB9, which encodes a predicted multiple-spanning transmembrane domain and a nucleotide-binding domain with Walker motifs. It is therefore designated as a "half" ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Northern analysis shows that the ABCB9 mRNA is expressed at a high level in testes and moderate levels in brain and spinal cord. A splice variant mRNA deleted in the last pair of predicted transmembrane segments was shown to be expressed in human tissues. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ABCB9 is closely related to TAP1 and TAP2, two "half" ABC proteins found in endoplasmic reticulum. ABCB9 protein colocalized with the lysosomal markers, LAMP1 and LAMP2, in transfected cells. ABCB9 protein appears to be most highly expressed in the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules in mouse and rat testes. These cells have high levels of phagocytosis and secretory activities. These findings pave the way for further investigation into the potential novel function of ABCB9 in lysosomes.

10779507|t|Localization and genomic organization of a new hepatocellular organic anion transporting polypeptide.
10779507|a|Based on sequence homology to the human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2; SLC21A6), we cloned a new member of the SLC21A superfamily of solute carriers, termed OATP8 (SLC21A8). The protein of 702 amino acids showed an amino acid identity of 80% with human OATP2. Based on Northern blotting, the expression of OATP8 was restricted to human liver. Cosmid clones containing the genes encoding human OATP1 (SLC21A3), OATP2 (SLC21A6), and OATP8 (SLC21A8) served to establish their genomic organization. All three genes contained 14 exons with 13 identical splice sites when transferred to the amino acid sequence. An antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus localized OATP8 to the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes and the recombinant glycoprotein, expressed in MDCKII cells, to the lateral membrane. Transport properties of OATP8 were studied in stably transfected MDCKII and HEK293 cells. Organic anions transported by human OATP8 included sulfobromophthalein, with a K(m) of 3.3 microm, and 17beta-glucuronosyl estradiol, with a K(m) of 5.4 microm. Several bile salts were not substrates. Thus, human OATP8 is a new uptake transporter in the basolateral hepatocyte membrane with an overlapping but distinct substrate specificity as compared with OATP2, which is localized to the same membrane domain.

10799322|t|Cloning, characterization, and expression of the human TIN-ag-RP gene encoding a novel putative extracellular matrix protein.
10799322|a|The human gene encoding a novel tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen (TIN-ag)-related protein (TIN-ag-RP) was isolated, and its genomic organization was determined. BLAST searches revealed the highest degree of homology to several mammalian TIN-ag orthologues, and a weak homology to cathepsin B-like proteases. The 12 kb gene was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosome 1p34.2-3, a locus neither related to that of the human TIN-ag (6p11.2-12) nor to that of cathepsin B (8p22-23.1). The TIN-ag-RP is encoded in ten exons with introns ranging from 83 bp to 4 kb. In addition, the gene contained one exon in the 5'UTR, but none in the 3'UTR. Five of the 10 splice sites of the TIN-ag-RP gene were fully conserved when compared to a related gene of C. elegans, whereas only one splice site was identical to those found in cathepsin B genes. Furthermore, human TIN-ag-RP tagged with the T7-epitope, was expressed in HeLa cells, and was found to be localized in vesicular compartments as well as secreted into the medium suggesting the involvement of the endosomal trafficking pathway. Based on the high degree of homology of the amino acid sequences and genomic organization between TIN-ag-RP and TIN-ag, we suggest that both molecules may form a distinct group or family of TIN-ag-like proteins.

10831842|t|Molecular cloning, chromosome mapping and characterization of UBQLN3 a testis-specific gene that contains an ubiquitin-like domain.
10831842|a|The sequence of the ubiquitin protein is highly conserved between species and has facilitated the cloning of numerous ubiquitin-like proteins. In the present study, we report the cloning of the cDNA for human ubiquilin 3 (UBQLN3). The deduced amino acid sequence of UBQLN3 contains a UBQ domain (ubiquitin-like) in the amino terminus as well as two highly conserved domains found in several recently cloned ubiquitin-like proteins. One of these domains, termed the NP domain, is a highly conserved 93 amino acid region present in UBQLN3 and several ubiquitin-like proteins. The last conserved domain is the UBA domain (ubiquitin-associated) found in a variety of proteins of the ubiquination pathway. The human UBQLN3 gene was mapped to the 11p15 region of chromosome 11. Northern blot analysis of multiple human and mouse tissues demonstrated UBQLN3 mRNA expression specifically in testis.

10866201|t|Excessive placental secretion of neurokinin B during the third trimester causes pre-eclampsia.
10866201|a|Pre-eclampsia is a principal cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, affecting 5-10% of first pregnancies worldwide. Manifestations include increased blood pressure, proteinuria, coagulopathy and peripheral and cerebral oedema. Although the aetiology and pathogenesis remain to be elucidated, the placenta is undoubtedly involved, as termination of pregnancy eradicates the disease. Here we have cloned a complementary DNA from human placental messenger RNA encoding a precursor protein of 121 amino acids which gives rise to a mature peptide identical to the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) of other mammalian species. In female rats, concentrations of NKB several-fold above that of an animal 20 days into pregnancy caused substantial pressor activity. In human pregnancy, the expression of NKB was confined to the outer syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta, significant concentrations of NKB could be detected in plasma as early as week 9, and plasma concentrations of NKB were grossly elevated in pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia. We conclude that elevated levels of NKB in early pregnancy may be an indicator of hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms.

Chromosomal mapping indicates that Pop1 and Pop3 genes are clustered on mouse chromosome 10, whereas Pop2 maps to mouse chromosome 16. We found evidence that POP1 and POP3 in chicken may also be linked and multiple transcript isoforms are generated from this locus. The POP genes encode proteins with three potential transmembrane domains that are conserved in all family members. Individual POP genes exhibit specific expression patterns during development and postnatally. Chicken POP3 and mouse Pop1 are first preferentially expressed in atrium and later also in the subepicardial compact layer of the ventricles. Chicken POP1 and mouse Pop2 are expressed in the entire heart except the outflow tract. All three Pop genes are expressed in heart and skeletal muscle of the adult mouse and lower in lung. Pop1 and Pop2 expression is upregulated in uterus of pregnant mice. Like the mouse genes, human POP genes are predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The strong conservation of POP genes during evolution and their preferential expression in heart and skeletal muscle suggest that these novel proteins may have an important function in these tissues in vertebrates.

10882741|t|Identification, cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL3.
10882741|a|The human ELL gene, which is a frequent target for translocation in acute myeloid leukemia, was initially isolated from rat liver nuclei and found to be an RNA polymerase II elongation factor. Based on homology to ELL, we later cloned ELL2 and demonstrated that it can also increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. To better understand the role of ELL proteins in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, we have initiated a search for proteins related to ELLs. In this report, we describe the molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of ELL3, a novel RNA polymerase II elongation factor approximately 50% similar to both ELL and ELL2. Our transcriptional studies have demonstrated that ELL3 can also increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. The C-terminal domain of ELL, which we recently demonstrated to be required and sufficient for the immortalization of myeloid progenitor cells, shares strong similarities to the C-terminal domain of ELL3. ELL3 was localized by immunofluorescence to the nucleus of cells, and Northern analysis indicated that ELL3 is a testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factor.

10888605|t|The SCA8 transcript is an antisense RNA to a brain-specific transcript encoding a novel actin-binding protein (KLHL1).
10888605|a|Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat that is transcribed as part of an untranslated RNA. As a step towards understanding the molecular pathology of SCA8, we have defined the genomic organization of the SCA8 RNA transcripts and assembled a 166 kb segment of genomic sequence containing the repeat. The most striking feature of the SCA8 transcripts is that the most 5' exon is transcribed through the first exon of another gene that is transcribed in the opposite orientation. This gene arrangement suggests that the SCA8 transcript is an endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the transcription and translation start sites as well as the first splice donor sequence of the sense gene. The sense transcript encodes a 748 amino acid protein with a predicted domain structure typical of a family of actin-organizing proteins related to the Drosophila Kelch gene, and so has been given the name Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1). We have identified the full-length cDNA sequence for both the human and mouse KLHLI genes, and have elucidated the general genomic organization of the human gene. The predicted open reading frame and promoter region are highly conserved, and both genes are primarily expressed in specific brain tissues, including the cerebellum, the tissue most affected by SCA8. Transfection studies with epitope-tagged KLHL1 demonstrate that the protein localizes to the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may play a role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton of the brain cells in which it is expressed.

10936056|t|Cloning and characterization of human DDX24 and mouse Ddx24, two novel putative DEAD-Box proteins, and mapping DDX24 to human chromosome 14q32.
10936056|a|DEAD-box proteins are a large group of putative RNA helicases that exist ubiquitously in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. They are likely to play important roles in many different RNA metabolic processes. In this paper, we report the cloning of human DDX24, a putative DEAD-box protein, and its ortholog, Ddx24 in mouse. The deduced proteins encoded by these two cDNAs share 78.7% identity at the amino acid level and possess all the well-conserved motifs of DEAD-box proteins. However, little homology can be found between them and other DEAD-box proteins, even in their core region (identity <40%). Northern blot analysis showed that a 3.0-kb transcript of human DDX24 exists ubiquitously in the 16 human tissues examined and was most abundant in heart and brain, but with lowest levels in thymus and small intestine. The mouse Ddx24, whose transcript is 4.0 kb, was also expressed widely in 10 tissues tested with the highest level in heart and testis. By radiation hybrid mapping, the human DDX24 gene was localized to human chromosome 14q32 between the markers D14S81 and D14S265. Moreover, the gene structure of DDX24 was determined by comparing its cDNA and genomic sequence from BAC R-1089B7, which showed that the gene spanned a 30-kb region and consisted of at least nine exons.

10944437|t|Cloning, genomic organization, and tissue distribution of human Ssf-1.
10944437|a|During the screening of a human placenta cDNA library, realized in order to isolate the P2Y(11) coding sequence, an unrelated cDNA was cloned. We identified a 1422 bp open reading frame encoding a human protein displaying 40% amino acid identity with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssf-1, a protein involved in the second step of mRNA splicing. Sequencing of the corresponding genomic DNA showed that the gene encoding human Ssf-1 is located upstream to the P2Y(11) gene on chromosome 19p31. Comparison of the cDNA and genomic DNA sequences revealed that the human Ssf-1 gene is split into 12 exons. Northern blotting experiments showed that the 1.7 kb Ssf-1 mRNA presents an ubiquitous tissue expression. We also show that, in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, Ssf-1 mRNA is rapidly upregulated following a treatment by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and dibutyryl-cyclicAMP, two agents known to induce the granulocytic differentiation of these cells.

10950930|a|The gene encoding activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a member of the cytidine deaminase family, was isolated from a murine B cell lymphoma line, CH12F3-2, induced by combined stimulation of TGF-beta, IL-4, and CD40L. We have isolated the human orthologue of mouse AID cDNA, which has an open reading frame of 198 residues containing a conserved cytidine deaminase motif. The amino acid sequence of human AID is 92% identical to that of mouse AID. RT-PCR analysis of 15 human tissues showed that AID mRNA is expressed strongly in lymph nodes and tonsils. The complete human AID gene consisting of five exons was isolated and mapped to chromosome 12p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.   Copyright 2000 Academic Press.

10954742|t|Human interleukin-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor: molecular cloning and functional characterization as an hepatocyte-stimulating factor.
10954742|a|IL-10-related T cell-derived inducible factor (IL-TIF or IL-21) is a new cytokine structurally related to IL-10 and originally identified in the mouse as a gene induced by IL-9 in T cells and mast cells. Here, we report the cloning of the human IL-TIF cDNA, which shares 79% amino acid identity with mouse IL-TIF and 25% identity with human IL-10. Recombinant human IL-TIF was found to activate signal transducer and activator of transcription factors-1 and -3 in several hepatoma cell lines. IL-TIF stimulation of HepG2 human hepatoma cells up-regulated the production of acute phase reactants such as serum amyloid A, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and haptoglobin. Although IL-10 and IL-TIF have distinct activities, antibodies directed against the beta chain of the IL-10 receptor blocked the induction of acute phase reactants by IL-TIF, indicating that this chain is a common component of the IL-10 and IL-TIF receptors. Similar acute phase reactant induction was observed in mouse liver upon IL-TIF injection, and IL-TIF expression was found to be rapidly increased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, suggesting that this cytokine contributes to the inflammatory response in vivo.

10967134|t|Complete nucleotide sequence and genomic structure of the human NRAMP1 gene region on chromosome region 2q35.
10967134|a|Several lines of independent evidence suggest that human Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 gene (NRAMP1) is an important regulator of susceptibility to infectious diseases caused by certain intracellular pathogens. Here, we report the nucleotide sequence of 32198 bp of genomic DNA overlapping NRAMP1 on chromosomal region 2q35. The NRAMP1 gene spans 13604 bp. The gene and its 5' genomic region are highly enriched for DNA repeat sequences. A second gene was identified in the immediate vicinity of NRAMP1 and was tentatively named Nuclear LIM Interactor-Interacting Factor (NLI-IF) by analogy to its closest ortholog. The human NLI-IF gene begins 4721 bp downstream of the NRAMP1 stop codon and is composed of seven exons varying in size from 57 bp to 1644 bp. The gene gives rise to a 2655-bp mRNA transcript that contains a 783-bp open reading frame. The predicted molecular weight of the 261-amino acid NLI-IF protein is 29.2 kDa. Several putative gene regulatory elements were identified in the 5' upstream region of NLI-IF, including consensus binding sequences for Sp1, AP-2, NF-kappa B, and PU 1. The NLI-IF amino acid sequence has homology to proteins that have a high degree of homology with the NLI-interacting factor from Gallus gallus and are found in divergent species ranging from yeast to plants. NLI-IF is part of a human gene family encoding four related proteins of unknown function. Northern blot analysis of 15 different human tissues revealed a 2.6-kb NLI-IF mRNA that was ubiquitously expressed, but at varying levels. A second transcript with estimated size of 7 kb was expressed only in the placenta. Our data provide new sequence information about the NRAMP1 gene region that will be useful in the search for genetic variants causally involved in altered susceptibility to infectious diseases.

10967136|t|The WFDC1 gene encoding ps20 localizes to 16q24, a region of LOH in multiple cancers.
10967136|a|We previously identified ps20 protein as a secreted growth inhibitor and purified the protein from fetal rat prostate urogenital sinus mesenchymal cell conditioned medium. The rat cDNA was subsequently cloned, and ps20 was found to contain a WAP-type four-disulfide core motif, indicating it may function as a protease inhibitor. We now report cloning and characterization of the mouse ps20 gene (designated Wfdc1), the human homolog cDNA, and the human gene (designated WFDC1). Both the mouse and human WFDC1 genes consist of seven exons and encode respective ps20 proteins sharing 79.1% identity and nearly identical WAP motifs in exon 2. The WFDC1 gene was mapped by FISH analysis to human Chromosome (Chr) 16q24, an area of frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) previously identified in multiple cancers including prostate, breast, hepatocellular, and Wilms' tumor. Identification and characterization of the WFDC1 gene may aid in better understanding the potential role of this gene and ps20 in prostate biology and carcinogenesis.

10978331|t|Retrovirally mediated complementation of the glyB phenotype. Cloning of a human gene encoding the carrier for entry of folates into mitochondria.
10978331|a|The transduction of a human placental cDNA retroviral library into glyB cells, a Chinese hamster ovary K1 subline that is deficient in the transport of folates into mitochondria, resulted in the complementation of glycine auxotrophy of these cells. A 2.6-kilobase pair cDNA insert flanked by retroviral sequences had integrated into genomic DNA in rescued cells. An open reading frame in this cDNA encoded a 35-kDa protein homologous to several inner mitochondrial wall transporters for intermediate metabolites. The subcloned cDNA complemented the glycine auxotrophy of glyB cells and reinstated folate accumulation in the mitochondria of transfected cells. The human origin, chromosomal location, and intron-exon organization of the isolated mitochondrial folate transporter gene were deduced from the expressed sequence tag database and human genome project data.

10993894|t|The orthologous human and murine semaphorin 6A-1 proteins (SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1) bind to the enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-like protein (EVL) via a novel carboxyl-terminal zyxin-like domain.
10993894|a|Neuronal development and apoptosis critically depend on the transformation of extracellular signals to intracellular actions resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements. Ena/VASP (enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) proteins play an important role in actin and filament dynamics, whereas members of the semaphorin protein family are guidance signals in embryo- and organogenesis. Here, we report the identification of two novel transmembranous human and murine semaphorins, (HSA)SEMA6A-1 and (MMU)Sema6A-1. These semaphorin 6 variants directly link the Ena/VASP and the semaphorin protein family, since SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is capable of a selective binding to the protein EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein). EVL is the third member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins that was identified sharing the same structural features as Mena (mammalian enabled) and VASP, although its functionality seems to be different from that of the other members. Here we demonstrate that SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is colocalized with EVL via its zyxin-like carboxyl-terminal domain that contains a modified binding motif, which further stresses the existence of functional differences between EVL and Mena/VASP. In addition these findings suggest a completely new role for transmembranous semaphorins such as SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 in retrograde signaling.

11007475|a|The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene, specifically expressed in germinal center B cells in mice, is a member of the cytidine deaminase family. We herein report mutations in the human counterpart of AID in patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2). Three major abnormalities characterize AID deficiency: (1) the absence of immunoglobulin class switch recombination, (2) the lack of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations, and (3) lymph node hyperplasia caused by the presence of giant germinal centers. The phenotype observed in HIGM2 patients (and in AID-/- mice) demonstrates the absolute requirement for AID in several crucial steps of B cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses.

11027560|t|Molecular cloning of a human, hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline transporter.
11027560|a|Under many physiological circumstances, Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3)-sensitive, high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) in cholinergic neurons is thought to be rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of acetylcholine (ACh). Based on sequence information provided by the Human Genome Project and the recently reported rat CHT1 (rCHT1), we cloned a human CHT cDNA from spinal cord. The hCHT cDNA encodes a protein of 580 amino acids having 93% identity to rCHT1 and 51% identity to the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog CHO-1, and is distantly related to members of the Na(+)-coupled glucose transporter (SGLT) gene family of Na(+)-coupled glucose (SGLT), nucleoside and iodide transporters. Northern blot analysis reveals the expression of a approximately 5 kb transcript in human brain regions rich in cholinergic neurons including the putamen, spinal cord, and medulla. Expression of hCHT cDNA in COS-7 cells results in saturable, Na(+)/Cl(-)-dependent choline uptake (K(m) = 1.2 microM) in membrane vesicles and  HC-3 binding (K(d) = 4 nM) in membrane fractions, consistent with characteristics reported in mammalian cholinergic neurons. Using radiation hybrid mapping techniques, we localized the hCHT gene to human chromosome 2q12. These studies elucidate the primary structure and chromosomal localization of hCHT and provide a basis for mechanistic analysis of HACU regulation and an investigation of the role of hCHT in disease states.

11042359|t|Cloning, localisation and functional expression of a novel human, cerebellum specific, two pore domain potassium channel.
11042359|a|We have isolated, by degenerate PCR, a complementary DNA encoding a novel two pore domain potassium channel. This is the 7th functional member of the human tandem pore domain potassium channel family to be reported. It has an open reading frame of 1.125 kb and encodes a 374 amino acid protein which shows 62% identity to the human TASK-1 gene: identity to other human members of the family is 31-35% at the amino acid level. We believe this gene to be human TASK-3, the ortholog of the recently reported rat TASK-3 gene: amino acid identity between the two is 74%. 'Taqman' mRNA analysis demonstrated a very specific tissue distribution pattern, showing human TASK-3 mRNA to be localised largely in the cerebellum, in contrast rat TASK-3 was reported to be widely distributed. We have shown by radiation hybrid mapping that human TASK-3 can be assigned to chromosome 8q24.3. Human TASK-3 was demonstrated to endow Xenopus oocytes with a negative resting membrane potential through the presence of a large K(+) selective conductance. TASK-3 is inhibited by extracellular acidosis with a mid-point of inhibition around pH 6. 5, supporting the predictions from the sequence data that this is a third human TASK (TWIK-related acid sensitive K(+) channel) gene.

11054547|t|Human serine racemase: moleular cloning, genomic organization and functional analysis.
11054547|a|High levels of D-serine are found in mammalian brain, where it is an endogenous agonist of the strichinine-insensitive site of N-methyl D-aspartate type of glutamate receptors. D-serine is enriched in protoplasmic astrocytes that occur in gray matter areas of the brain and was shown to be synthesized from L-serine. We now report cloning and expression of human serine racemase, an enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of D-serine from L-serine. The enzyme displays a high homology to the murine serine racemase. It contains a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate attachment sequence similar to bacterial biosynthetic threonine dehydratase. Northern-blot analysis show high levels of human serine racemase in areas known to contain large amounts of endogenous D-serine, such as hippocampus and corpus callosum. Robust synthesis of D-serine was detected in cells transfected with human serine racemase, demonstrating the conservation of D-amino acid metabolism in humans. Serine racemase may be a therapeutic target in psychiatric diseases as supplementation of D-serine greatly improves schizophrenia symptoms. We identify the human serine racemase genomic structure and show that the gene encompasses seven exons and localizes to chromosome 17q13.3. Identification of the intron-exon boundaries of the human serine racemase gene will be useful to search for mutations in neuropsychiatric disorders.

11062248|t|Molecular cloning and characterization of the human protein kinase D2. A novel member of the protein kinase D family of serine threonine kinases.
11062248|a|We have isolated the full-length cDNA of a novel human serine threonine protein kinase gene. The deduced protein sequence contains two cysteine-rich motifs at the N terminus, a pleckstrin homology domain, and a catalytic domain containing all the characteristic sequence motifs of serine protein kinases. It exhibits the strongest homology to the serine threonine protein kinases PKD/PKCmicro and PKCnu, particularly in the duplex zinc finger-like cysteine-rich motif, in the pleckstrin homology domain and in the protein kinase domain. In contrast, it shows only a low degree of sequence similarity to other members of the PKC family. Therefore, the new protein has been termed protein kinase D2 (PKD2). The mRNA of PKD2 is widely expressed in human and murine tissues. It encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 105 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which is expressed in various human cell lines, including HL60 cells, which do not express PKCmicro. In vivo phorbol ester binding studies demonstrated a concentration-dependent binding of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to PKD2. The addition of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate in the presence of dioleoylphosphatidylserine stimulated the autophosphorylation of PKD2 in a synergistic fashion. Phorbol esters also stimulated autophosphorylation of PKD2 in intact cells. PKD2 activated by phorbol esters efficiently phosphorylated the exogenous substrate histone H1. In addition, we could identify the C-terminal Ser(876) residue as an in vivo phosphorylation site within PKD2. Phosphorylation of Ser(876) of PKD2 correlated with the activation status of the kinase. Finally, gastrin was found to be a physiological activator of PKD2 in human AGS-B cells stably transfected with the CCK(B)/gastrin receptor. Thus, PKD2 is a novel phorbol ester- and growth factor-stimulated protein kinase.

11081504|t|Interleukin 21 and its receptor are involved in NK cell expansion and regulation of lymphocyte function.
11081504|a|Cytokines are important in the regulation of haematopoiesis and immune responses, and can influence lymphocyte development. Here we have identified a class I cytokine receptor that is selectively expressed in lymphoid tissues and is capable of signal transduction. The full-length receptor was expressed in BaF3 cells, which created a functional assay for ligand detection and cloning. Conditioned media from activated human CD3+ T cells supported proliferation of the assay cell line. We constructed a complementary DNA expression library from activated human CD3+ T cells, and identified a cytokine with a four-helix-bundle structure using functional cloning. This cytokine is most closely related to IL2 and IL15, and has been designated IL21 with the receptor designated IL21 R. In vitro assays suggest that IL21 has a role in the proliferation and maturation of natural killer (NK) cell populations from bone marrow, in the proliferation of mature B-cell populations co-stimulated with anti-CD40, and in the proliferation of T cells co-stimulated with anti-CD3.

11086001|t|betaIV spectrin, a new spectrin localized at axon initial segments and nodes of ranvier in the central and peripheral nervous system.
11086001|a|We report the identification of betaIV spectrin, a novel spectrin isolated as an interactor of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase-like protein ICA512. The betaIV spectrin gene is located on human and mouse chromosomes 19q13.13 and 7b2, respectively. Alternative splicing of betaIV spectrin generates at least four distinct isoforms, numbered betaIVSigma1-betaIVSigma4 spectrin. The longest isoform (betaIVSigma1 spectrin) includes an actin-binding domain, followed by 17 spectrin repeats, a specific domain in which the amino acid sequence ERQES is repeated four times, several putative SH3-binding sites and a pleckstrin homology domain. betaIVSigma2 and betaIVSigma3 spectrin encompass the NH(2)- and COOH-terminal halves of betaIVSigma1 spectrin, respectively, while betaIVSigma4 spectrin lacks the ERQES and the pleckstrin homology domain. Northern blots revealed an abundant expression of betaIV spectrin transcripts in brain and pancreatic islets. By immunoblotting, betaIVSigma1 spectrin is recognized as a protein of 250 kD. Anti-betaIV spectrin antibodies also react with two additional isoforms of 160 and 140 kD. These isoforms differ from betaIVSigma1 spectrin in terms of their distribution on subcellular fractionation, detergent extractability, and phosphorylation. In islets, the immunoreactivity for betaIV spectrin is more prominent in alpha than in beta cells. In brain, betaIV spectrin is enriched in myelinated neurons, where it colocalizes with ankyrin(G) 480/270-kD at axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. Likewise, betaIV spectrin is concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier in the rat sciatic nerve. In the rat hippocampus, betaIVSigma1 spectrin is detectable from embryonic day 19, concomitantly with the appearance of immunoreactivity at the initial segments. Thus, we suggest that betaIVSigma1 spectrin interacts with ankyrin(G) 480/270-kD and participates in the clustering of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and cell-adhesion molecules at initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.

11102511|t|Human orthologs of yeast vacuolar protein sorting proteins Vps26, 29, and 35: assembly into multimeric complexes.
11102511|a|Sorting nexin (SNX) 1 and SNX2 are mammalian orthologs of Vps5p, a yeast protein that is a subunit of a large multimeric complex, termed the retromer complex, involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. We report the cloning and characterization of human orthologs of three additional components of the complex: Vps26p, Vps29p, and Vps35p. The close structural similarity between the yeast and human proteins suggests a similarity in function. We used both yeast two-hybrid assays and expression in mammalian cells to define the binding interactions among these proteins. The data suggest a model in which hVps35 serves as the core of a multimeric complex by binding directly to hVps26, hVps29, and SNX1. Deletional analyses of hVps35 demonstrate that amino acid residues 1-53 and 307-796 of hVps35 bind to the coiled coil-containing domain of SNX1. In contrast, hVps26 binds to amino acid residues 1-172 of hVps35, whereas hVps29 binds to amino acid residues 307-796 of hVps35. Furthermore, hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 have been found in membrane-associated and cytosolic compartments. Gel filtration chromatography of COS7 cell cytosol showed that both recombinant and endogenous hVps35, hVps29, and hVps26 coelute as a large complex ( approximately 220-440 kDa). In the absence of hVps35, neither hVps26 nor hVps29 is found in the large complex. These data provide the first insights into the binding interactions among subunits of a putative mammalian retromer complex.

11110791|t|Three novel components of the human exosome.
11110791|a|The yeast exosome is a complex of 3' --> 5' exoribonucleases. Sequence analysis identified putative human homologues for exosome components, although several were found only as expressed sequence tags. Here we report the cloning of full-length cDNAs, which encode putative human homologues of the Rrp40p, Rrp41p, and Rrp46p components of the exosome. Recombinant proteins were expressed and used to raise rabbit antisera. In Western blotting experiments, these decorated HeLa cell proteins of the predicted sizes. All three human proteins were enriched in the HeLa cells nucleus and nucleolus, but were also clearly detected in the cytoplasm. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p were present in a large complex. This cofractionated with the human homologues of other exosome components, hRrp4p and PM/Scl-100. Anti-PM/Scl-positive patient sera coimmunoprecipitated hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p demonstrating their physical association. The immunoprecipitated complex exhibited 3' --> 5' exoribonuclease activity in vitro. hRrp41p was expressed in yeast and shown to suppress the lethality of genetic depletion of yeast Rrp41p. We conclude that hRrp40p, hRrp41p, and hRrp46p represent novel components of the human exosome complex.

11121057|t|Comparative structural and functional analysis of the olfactory receptor genes flanking the human and mouse beta-globin gene clusters.
11121057|a|By sequencing regions flanking the beta-globin gene complex in mouse (Hbbc) and human (HBBC), we have shown that the beta-globin gene cluster is surrounded by a larger cluster of olfactory receptor genes (ORGs). To facilitate sequence comparisons and to investigate the regulation of ORG expression, we have mapped 5' sequences of mRNA from olfactory epithelium encoding beta-globin-proximal ORGs. We have found that several of these genes contain multiple noncoding exons that can be alternatively spliced. Surprisingly, the only common motifs found in the promoters of these genes are a "TATA" box and a purine-rich motif. Sequence comparisons between human and mouse reveal that most of the conserved regions are confined to the coding regions and transcription units of the genes themselves, but a few blocks of conserved sequence also are found outside of ORG transcription units. The possible influence of beta-globin regulatory sequences on ORG expression in olfactory epithelium was tested in mice containing a deletion of the endogenous beta-globin locus control region, but no change in expression of the neighboring ORGs was detected. We evaluate the implications of these results for possible mechanisms of regulation of ORG transcription.

11133773|t|Characterization of human sialoadhesin, a sialic acid binding receptor expressed by resident and inflammatory macrophage populations.
11133773|a|Sialoadhesin is a macrophage-restricted cellular interaction molecule and a prototypic member of the Siglec family of sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins. So far, it has only been characterized in rodents. Here, we report the molecular cloning, binding properties, and expression pattern of human sialoadhesin. The predicted protein sequences of human and mouse sialoadhesin are about 72% identical, with the greatest similarity in the extracellular region, which comprises 17 Ig domains in both species. A recombinant protein consisting of the first 4 N-terminal domains of human sialoadhesin fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 mediated sialic acid-dependent binding with a specificity similar to its mouse counterpart, preferring sialic acid in the alpha2,3 glycosidic linkage over the alpha2,6 linkage. By flow cytometry with peripheral blood leukocytes, recombinant sialoadhesin bound strongly to granulocytes with intermediate binding to monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, and a subset of CD8 T cells. Using antibodies raised to the recombinant protein, sialoadhesin was immunoprecipitated from the THP-1 human monocytic cell line as an approximate 200-kd glycoprotein. The expression pattern of human sialoadhesin was found to be similar to that of the mouse receptor, being absent from monocytes and other peripheral blood leukocytes, but expressed strongly by tissue macrophages in the spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, liver, colon, and lungs. High expression was also found on inflammatory macrophages present in affected tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

11152476|t|The neural cell recognition molecule neurofascin interacts with syntenin-1 but not with syntenin-2, both of which reveal self-associating activity.
11152476|a|Neurofascin belongs to the L1 subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and is implicated in axonal growth and fasciculation. We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with neurofascin intracellularly and therefore might link it to trafficking, spatial targeting, or signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that rat syntenin-1, previously published as syntenin, mda-9, or TACIP18 in human, is a neurofascin-binding protein that exhibits a wide-spread tissue expression pattern with a relative maximum in brain. Syntenin-1 was found not to interact with other vertebrate members of the L1 subgroup such as L1 itself or NrCAM. We confirmed the specificity of the neurofascin-syntenin-1 interaction by ligand-overlay assay, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and colocalization of both proteins in heterologous cells. The COOH terminus of neurofascin was mapped to interact with the second PDZ domain of syntenin-1. Furthermore, we isolated syntenin-2 that may be expressed in two isoforms. Despite their high sequence similarity to syntenin-1, syntenin-2alpha, which interacts with neurexin I, and syntenin-2beta do not bind to neurofascin or several other transmembrane proteins that are binding partners of syntenin-1. Finally, we report that syntenin-1 and -2 both form homodimers and can interact with each other.

11152479|t|Identification of a novel thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein.
11152479|a|We recently identified a series of transforming growth factor-beta-responsive genes in A549 human adenocarcinoma cell line by a gene trap screening method. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of one of these genes, designated TMX, that encodes a novel protein of 280 amino acid residues. The TMX protein possesses an N-terminal signal peptide followed by one thioredoxin (Trx)-like domain with a unique active site sequence, Cys-Pro-Ala-Cys, and a potential transmembrane domain. There are putative TMX homologs with identical active site sequences in the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila genomes. Using recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, we demonstrated the activity of the Trx domain of TMX to cleave the interchain disulfide bridges in insulin in vitro. The TMX transcript is widely expressed in normal human tissues, and subcellular fractionation and immunostaining for an epitope-tagged TMX protein suggest that TMX is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When TMX was expressed in HEK293 cells, it significantly suppressed the apoptosis induced by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER-Golgi transport. This activity was abolished when two Cys residues in the active site sequence were mutated to Ser, suggesting that the Trx-like activity of TMX may help relieve ER stress caused by brefeldin A.

11259612|t|Identification of two prokineticin cDNAs: recombinant proteins potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle.
11259612|a|The motility of gastrointestinal tract is regulated by classical neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and humoral agents. Two novel human cDNAs have been cloned based on their sequence similarity to a frog skin secretion protein, Bv8, and a nontoxic protein of mamba snake venom. These human cDNAs encode two secreted proteins of 86 and 81 amino acids. Northern blot hybridization has revealed that these cDNAs are expressed in gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach. Recombinant proteins with authentic N-terminal sequences have been produced in Escherichia coli and refolded into functional proteins by careful control of protein aggregation. Mass spectrometry has confirmed the formation of five pairs of disulfide bonds. The refolded recombinant proteins potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle with EC(50) values in the subnanomolar range. The contractile effects of the recombinant proteins are specific for gastrointestinal smooth muscle, because they have no effect on vascular or respiratory smooth muscle. To reflect their potent and specific effects on gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, we have named these recombinant proteins prokineticins. Ligand binding studies with iodinated prokineticin revealed the presence of a high-affinity site in ileal smooth muscle. The displacement of specific binding by GTP gamma S suggests that the prokineticin receptor may belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Experiments with verapamil and nifedipine revealed that calcium influx is essential for the contractile activity of prokineticins on gastrointestinal smooth muscle. In summary, we have identified two novel endogenous regulators of gastrointestinal motility. The availability of recombinant prokineticins should provide novel therapeutic agents for disorders involving impaired gastrointestinal motility.

11278579|t|Expression of CaT-like, a novel calcium-selective channel, correlates with the malignancy of prostate cancer.
11278579|a|The regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) plays a key role in the development and growth of cells. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of a highly calcium-selective channel localized on the human chromosome 7. The sequence of the new channel is structurally related to the gene product of the CaT1 protein cloned from rat duodenum and is therefore called CaT-like (CaT-L). CaT-L is expressed in locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic and androgen-insensitive prostatic lesions but is undetectable in healthy prostate tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Additionally, CaT-L is expressed in normal placenta, exocrine pancreas, and salivary glands. New markers with well defined biological function that correlate with aberrant cell growth are needed for the molecular staging of cancer and to predict the clinical outcome. The human CaT-L channel represents a marker for prostate cancer progression and may serve as a target for therapeutic strategies.

11278593|t|Human corneal GlcNac 6-O-sulfotransferase and mouse intestinal GlcNac 6-O-sulfotransferase both produce keratan sulfate.
11278593|a|Human corneal N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase (hCGn6ST) has been identified by the positional candidate approach as the gene responsible for macular corneal dystrophy (MCD). Because of its high homology to carbohydrate sulfotransferases and the presence of mutations of this gene in MCD patients who lack sulfated keratan sulfate in the cornea and serum, hCGn6ST protein is thought to be a sulfotransferase that catalyzes sulfation of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. In this report, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of hCGn6ST by expressing it in cultured cells. A lysate prepared from HeLa cells transfected with an intact form of hCGn6ST cDNA or culture medium from cells transfected with a secreted form of hCGn6ST cDNA showed an activity of transferring sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc of synthetic oligosaccharide substrates in vitro. When hCGn6ST was expressed together with human keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase (hKSG6ST), HeLa cells produced highly sulfated carbohydrate detected by an anti-keratan sulfate antibody 5D4. These results indicate that hCGn6ST transfers sulfate to C-6 of GlcNAc in keratan sulfate. Amino acid substitutions in hCGn6ST identical to changes resulting from missense mutations found in MCD patients abolished enzymatic activity. Moreover, mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase had the same activity as hCGn6ST. This observation suggests that mouse intestinal GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase is the orthologue of hCGn6ST and functions as a sulfotransferase to produce keratan sulfate in the cornea.

11294830|t|A new spectrin, beta IV, has a major truncated isoform that associates with promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies and the nuclear matrix.
11294830|a|We isolated cDNAs that encode a 77-kDa peptide similar to repeats 10-16 of beta-spectrins. Its gene localizes to human chromosome 19q13.13-q13.2 and mouse chromosome 7, at 7.5 centimorgans. A 289-kDa isoform, similar to full-length beta-spectrins, was partially assembled from sequences in the human genomic DNA data base and completely cloned and sequenced. RNA transcripts are seen predominantly in the brain, and Western analysis shows a major peptide that migrates as a 72-kDa band. This new gene, spectrin betaIV, thus encodes a full-length minor isoform (SpbetaIVSigma1) and a truncated major isoform (SpbetaIVSigma5). Immunostaining of cells shows a micropunctate pattern in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In mesenchymal stem cells, the staining concentrates at nuclear dots that stain positively for the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Expression of SpbetaIVSigma5 fused to green fluorescence protein in cells produces nuclear dots that include all PML bodies, which double in number in transfected cells. Deletion analysis shows that partial repeats 10 and 16 of SpbetaIVSigma5 are necessary for nuclear dot formation. Immunostaining of whole-mount nuclear matrices reveals diffuse positivity with accentuation at PML bodies. Spectrin betaIV is the first beta-spectrin associated with a subnuclear structure and may be part of a nuclear scaffold to which gene regulatory machinery binds.

11337487|t|Extensive repertoire of membrane-bound and soluble dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin 1 (DC-SIGN1) and DC-SIGN2 isoforms. Inter-individual variation in expression of DC-SIGN transcripts.
11337487|a|Expression in dendritic cells (DCs) of DC-SIGN, a type II membrane protein with a C-type lectin ectodomain, is thought to play an important role in establishing the initial contact between DCs and resting T cells. DC-SIGN is also a unique type of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) attachment factor and promotes efficient infection in trans of cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. We have identified another gene, designated here as DC-SIGN2, that exhibits high sequence homology with DC-SIGN. Here we demonstrate that alternative splicing of DC-SIGN1 (original version) and DC-SIGN2 pre-mRNA generates a large repertoire of DC-SIGN-like transcripts that are predicted to encode membrane-associated and soluble isoforms. The range of DC-SIGN1 mRNA expression was significantly broader than previously reported and included THP-1 monocytic cells, placenta, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and there was cell maturation/activation-induced differences in mRNA expression levels. Immunostaining of term placenta with a DC-SIGN1-specific antiserum showed that DC-SIGN1 is expressed on endothelial cells and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-positive macrophage-like cells in the villi. DC-SIGN2 mRNA expression was high in the placenta and not detectable in PBMCs. In DCs, the expression of DC-SIGN2 transcripts was significantly lower than that of DC-SIGN1. Notably, there was significant inter-individual heterogeneity in the repertoire of DC-SIGN1 and DC-SIGN2 transcripts expressed. The genes for DC-SIGN1, DC-SIGN2, and CD23, another Type II lectin, colocalize to an approximately 85 kilobase pair region on chromosome 19p13.3, forming a cluster of related genes that undergo highly complex alternative splicing events. The molecular diversity of DC-SIGN-1 and -2 is reminiscent of that observed for certain other adhesive cell surface proteins involved in cell-cell connectivity. The generation of this large collection of polymorphic cell surface and soluble variants that exhibit inter-individual variation in expression levels has important implications for the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, as well as for the molecular code required to establish complex interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T cells, i.e. the immunological synapse.

11342225|t|Identification of the human crooked neck gene by comparative gene identification.
11342225|a|Drosophila melanogaster serves as a useful model organism for functional genomic studies, and its genome project was recently completed. We previously described a comparative-gene-identification approach to assist human ortholog gene identification that involves applying an entire proteome as an alignment template. Analysis of the available 14100 Drosophila protein sequences revealed that 37% of them (5228 sequences) might lead to discoveries of novel human genes. Upon further database interrogations, we found several putative full-length human gene transcripts, including the human crooked neck (crn) gene. Based on sequence gap-closure experiments using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction as well as bioinformatic analysis, we found that the assembled human cDNA contig of crooked neck gene was at least 3903 base pairs in length with alternative splicing variations which encoded mainly for a 687-amino-acid residue protein. The human crooked neck gene was located on chromosome 20 with at least 15 exons. The unique features of the 16 copies of the tetratrico peptide repeat (TPR) motif were conserved in the yeast, fly and human crooked neck orthologous proteins, which were important for spliceosome assembly in cells.

11342227|t|Identification of a novel fibroblast growth factor, FGF-22, preferentially expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle.
11342227|a|We isolated cDNA encoding a novel fibroblast growth factor (FGF-22) (170 amino acids) from human placenta. Of the FGF family members, FGF-22, which appears to be a secreted protein, is most similar to FGF-10 and FGF-7 (approximately 46% and approximately 40% amino acid identities, respectively). The human FGF-22 gene was localized on chromosome 19p13.3. We also isolated mouse cDNA encoding FGF-22 (162 amino acids) from the skin. Mouse FGF-22 shows high homology (87% amino acid identity) to human FGF-22. Mouse FGF-22 mRNA was found to be preferentially expressed in the skin among the mouse adult tissues examined by Northern blotting analysis. By in situ hybridization, FGF-22 mRNA in the skin was found to be preferentially expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. Therefore, FGF-22 is expected to be a unique FGF that plays a role in hair development.

11350119|t|Molecular cloning and mapping of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha10 (CHRNA10).
11350119|a|We report the isolation and initial characterization of a new member of the human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit family, alpha10 (CHRNA10), from both inner-ear neuroepithelium and lymphoid tissue. The cDNA is 1959 nucleotides in length, with a coding region predicting a protein of 451 amino acids that is 90% identical to rat alpha10. The alpha10 gene was localized to chromosome 11p15.5. Human alpha10 was detected in human inner-ear tissue, tonsil, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. We also detected the expression of the human nAChR alpha9 (CHRNA9) mRNA in these same tissues using RT-PCR and Northern blot hybridization.   Copyright 2001 Academic Press.

11555636|t|Large-scale identification of mammalian proteins localized to nuclear sub-compartments.
11555636|a|Many nuclear components participating in related pathways appear concentrated in specific areas of the mammalian nucleus. The importance of this organization is attested to by the dysfunction that correlates with mis-localization of nuclear proteins in human disease and cancer. Determining the sub-nuclear localization of proteins is therefore important for understanding genome regulation and function, and it also provides clues to function for novel proteins. However, the complexity of proteins in the mammalian nucleus is too large to tackle this on a protein by protein basis. Large-scale approaches to determining protein function and sub-cellular localization are required. We have used a visual gene trap screen to identify more than 100 proteins, many of which are normal, located within compartments of the mouse nucleus. The most common discrete localizations detected are at the nucleolus and the splicing speckles and on chromosomes. Proteins at the nuclear periphery, or in other nuclear foci, have also been identified. Several of the proteins have been implicated in human disease or cancer, e.g. ATRX, HMGI-C, NBS1 and EWS, and the gene-trapped proteins provide a route into further understanding their function. We find that sequence motifs are often shared amongst proteins co-localized within the same sub-nuclear compartment. Conversely, some generally abundant motifs are lacking from the proteins concentrated in specific areas of the nucleus. This suggests that we may be able to predict sub-nuclear localization for proteins in databases based on their sequence.

11559747|t|CHMP1 is a novel nuclear matrix protein affecting chromatin structure and cell-cycle progression.
11559747|a|The Polycomb-group (PcG) is a diverse set of proteins required for maintenance of gene silencing during development. In a screen for conserved partners of the PcG protein Polycomblike (Pcl), we have identified a new protein, human CHMP1 (CHromatin Modifying Protein; CHarged Multivesicular body Protein), which is encoded by an alternative open reading frame in the PRSM1 gene and is conserved in both complex and simple eukaryotes. CHMP1 contains a predicted bipartite nuclear localization signal and distributes as distinct forms to the cytoplasm and the nuclear matrix in all cell lines tested. We have constructed a stable HEK293 cell line that inducibly overexpresses CHMP1 under ecdysone control. Overexpressed CHMP1 localizes to a punctate subnuclear pattern, encapsulating regions of nuclease-resistant, condensed chromatin. These novel structures are also frequently surrounded by increased histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation. CHMP1 can recruit a PcG protein, BMI1, to these regions of condensed chromatin and can cooperate with co-expressed vertebrate Pcl in a Xenopus embryo PcG assay; this is consistent with a role in PcG function. In combination, these observations suggest that CHMP1 plays a role in stable gene silencing within the nucleus.

11559748|t|CHMP1 functions as a member of a newly defined family of vesicle trafficking proteins.
11559748|a|A multivesicular body is a vesicle-filled endosome that targets proteins to the interior of lysosomes. We have identified a conserved eukaryotic protein, human CHMP1, which is strongly implicated in multivesicular body formation. Immunocytochemistry and biochemical fractionation localize CHMP1 to early endosomes and CHMP1 physically interacts with SKD1/VPS4, a highly conserved protein directly linked to multivesicular body sorting in yeast. Similar to the action of a mutant SKD1 protein, overexpression of a fusion derivative of human CHMP1 dilates endosomal compartments and disrupts the normal distribution of several endosomal markers. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae further support a conserved role of CHMP1 in vesicle trafficking. Deletion of CHM1, the budding yeast homolog of CHMP1, results in defective sorting of carboxypeptidases S and Y and produces abnormal, multi-lamellar prevacuolar compartments. This phenotype classifies CHM1 as a member of the class E vacuolar protein sorting genes. Yeast Chm1p belongs to a structurally-related, but rather divergent family of proteins, including Vps24p and Snf7p and three novel proteins, Chm2p, Chm5p and Chm6p, which are all essential for multivesicular body sorting. These observations identify the conserved CHMP/Chmp family as a set of proteins fundamental to understanding multivesicular body sorting in eukaryotic organisms.

11566096|t|NXF5, a novel member of the nuclear RNA export factor family, is lost in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation.
11566096|a|Although X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) affects 2%-3% of the human population, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent interest in this topic led to the identification of several genes for which mutations result in the disturbance of cognitive development.   We identified a novel gene that is interrupted by an inv(X)(p21.1;q22) in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Molecular analysis of both breakpoint regions did not reveal an interrupted gene on Xp, but identified a novel nuclear RNA export factor (NXF) gene cluster, Xcen-NXF5-NXF2-NXF4-NXF3-Xqter, in which NXF5 is split by the breakpoint, leading to its functional nullisomy. The predicted NXF5 protein shows high similarity with the central part of the presumed mRNA nuclear export factor TAP/NXF1. Functional analysis of NXF5 demonstrates binding to RNA as well as to the RNA nuclear export-associated protein p15/NXT. In contrast to TAP/NXF1, overexpression studies localized NXF5 in the form of granules in the cell body and neurites of mature hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role in mRNA transport. The two newly identified mouse nxf homologs, nxf-a and nxf-b, which also map on X, show highest mRNA levels in the brain.   A novel member of the nuclear RNA export factor family is absent in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Although we did not find direct evidence for the involvement of NXF5 in MR, the gene could be involved in development, possibly through a process in mRNA metabolism in neurons.

11641404|t|The p53 family member genes are involved in the Notch signal pathway.
11641404|a|The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth and death in response to environmental stimuli such as DNA damage. p63/p51 and p73 were recently identified as members of the p53 gene family. In contrast to p53 however, p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancers. Mice that lack p53 are developmentally normal, while p63 and p73 appear to play critical roles in normal development. To determine how p63 and p73 are involved in normal development, we attempted to identify target genes that are specifically regulated by p63 and/or p73 but not by p53. We found that the Jagged1 (JAG1) and Jagged2 (JAG2) genes, encoding ligands for the Notch receptors, are up-regulated by p63 and p73. Furthermore, we identified a p63-binding site in the second intron of the JAG1 gene, which can directly interact with the p63 protein in vivo, as assessed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. A heterologous reporter assay revealed that this p63-binding site is a functional response element and is specific for p63. We also found a target of Notch signaling, HES-1 was up-regulated in Jurkat cells, in which Notch1 is highly expressed, when co-cultured with p63-transfected cells, suggesting that p63 can trigger the Notch signal pathway in neighboring cells. Our findings show an association between the p53 family genes and Notch signaling and suggest a potential molecular mechanism for the involvement of the p53 family genes in normal development.

Our results suggest that in the fruit fly GDP-fucose, the donor for fucosyltransferase reactions, is formed exclusively via the de novo pathway from GDP-mannose through enzymatic reactions catalyzed by GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase (GMER, also known as FX in man). The Drosophila genome does not have orthologs for the salvage pathway enzymes, i.e. fucokinase and GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase synthesizing GDP-fucose from fucose. In addition we identified two novel fucosyltransferases predicted to catalyze alpha1,3- and alpha1,6-specific linkages to the GlcNAc residues on glycans. No genes with the capacity to encode alpha1,2-specific fucosyltransferases were found. We also identified two novel genes coding for O-fucosyltransferases and a gene responsible for a fucosidase enzyme in the Drosophila genome. Finally, using the Drosophila CG4435 gene, we identified two novel human genes putatively coding for fucosyltransferases. This work can serve as a basis for further whole-genome approaches in mapping all possible glycosylation pathways and as a basic analysis leading to subsequent experimental studies to verify the predictions made in this work.

11750132|t|Identification of two novel human dynein light chain genes, DNLC2A and DNLC2B, and their expression changes in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from 68 Chinese patients.
11750132|a|Two full-length cDNAs, DNLC2A and DNLC2B, were cloned and characterized. Their open reading frames respectively encode 96 amino acids which are most closely homologous to roadblock/LC7, one member of an ancient dynein light chain protein family, conserved in nematode, fruit fly, mouse and rat. The DNLC2A was expressed in 12 of 16 human tissues examined, with especially strong expression in heart, liver and brain, whereas there was weak expression in lung, prostate, testis, small intestine and colon. The expression of DNLC2B was generally high compared with that of DNLC2A except in liver. Northern blotting and/or semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis examined the expression changes of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in 68 hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples. It was revealed that DNLC2A was up-regulated (45 out of the 68 cases) while DNLC2B was down-regulated (44 out of 68 cases), compared with their adjacent tumor-free liver tissues. Interestingly, among the total 68 liver cancer samples tested, DNLC2A was up-regulated while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 28 cases; DNLC2A was up-regulated while no obvious change was observed for DNLC2B in 10 cases; no obvious change was observed for DNLC2A while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 14 cases. Although the underlying mechanism is not clear to date, the apparent up-regulation of DNLC2A and down-regulation of DNLC2B suggest that these genes might be involved in tumor progression. On the other hand, the different expression changes of the two homologous genes indicate that hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by different pathological mechanisms. In addition, DNLC2A was assigned to human chromosome 20q12-q13.11 near the marker D20S106 by radiation hybrid mapping.

11895476|t|Isolation and characterization of a new nucleolar protein, Nrap, that is conserved from yeast to humans.
11895476|a|The nucleolus is the site of rRNA synthesis and processing in eukaryotic cells, but its composition remains poorly understood.   We have identified a novel nucleolar RNA-associated protein (Nrap) which is highly conserved from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to human, with homologues in mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and other species. In the mouse, we have found that Nrap is ubiquitously expressed and is specifically localized in the nucleolus. We have also identified splice variants in human and mouse, and defined the intron-exon structure of the human Nrap gene. Nrap is inherited into daughter nuclei by associating with the condensed chromosomes during mitosis. RNase treatment of permeabilized cells indicated that the nucleolar localization of Nrap is RNA dependent. The effects of actinomycin D, cycloheximide and 5,6-dichloro-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole on Nrap expression and distribution in cultured cells suggest that Nrap is associated with the pre-rRNA transcript.   Nrap is a large nucleolar protein (of more than 1000 amino acids), and is a new class of protein with new structural and functional motifs. Nrap appears to be associated with ribosome biogenesis by interacting with pre-rRNA primary transcript.

11897791|t|Identification of the mitochondrial glutamate transporter. Bacterial expression, reconstitution, functional characterization, and tissue distribution of two human isoforms.
11897791|a|The mitochondrial carriers are a family of transport proteins in the inner membranes of mitochondria. They shuttle substrates, metabolites, and cofactors through this membrane and connect cytoplasm functions with others in the matrix. Glutamate is co-transported with H(+) (or exchanged for OH(-)), but no protein has ever been associated with this activity. Two human expressed sequence tags encode proteins of 323 and 315 amino acids with 63% identity that are related to the aspartate-glutamate carrier, a member of the carrier family. They have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. Their transport properties demonstrate that the two proteins are isoforms of the glutamate/H(+) symporter described in the past in whole mitochondria. Isoform 1 is expressed at higher levels than isoform 2 in all the tissues except in brain, where the two isoforms are expressed at comparable levels. The differences in expression levels and kinetic parameters of the two isoforms suggest that isoform 2 matches the basic requirement of all tissues especially with respect to amino acid degradation, and isoform 1 becomes operative to accommodate higher demands associated with specific metabolic functions such as ureogenesis.

11909966|t|Identification of mammalian Sds3 as an integral component of the Sin3/histone deacetylase corepressor complex.
11909966|a|Silencing of gene transcription involves local chromatin modification achieved through the local recruitment of large multiprotein complexes containing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. The mammalian corepressors mSin3A and mSin3B have been shown to play a key role in this process by tethering HDACs 1 and 2 to promoter-bound transcription factors. Similar mechanisms appear to be operative in yeast, in which epistasis experiments have established that the mSin3 and HDAC orthologs (SIN3 and RPD3), along with a novel protein, SDS3, function in the same repressor pathway. Here, we report the identification of a component of the mSin3-HDAC complex that bears homology to yeast SDS3, physically associates with mSin3 proteins in vivo, represses transcription in a manner that is partially dependent on HDAC activity, and enables HDAC1 catalytic activity in vivo. That key physical and functional properties are also shared by yeast SDS3 underscores the central role of the Sin3-HDAC-Sds3 complex in eukaryotic cell biology, and the discovery of mSds3 in mammalian cells provides a new avenue for modulating the activity of this complex in human disease.

11955620|t|Isolation of a genomic clone containing the promoter region of the human ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6.
11955620|a|We previously reported on the isolation of a new rat ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6. We now report the isolation of the full-length cDNA and genomic clones containing the human ABCB6 gene. ABCB6 is 100% identical to the cloned MTABC3 human ABC transporter and contains the typical ABC signature, Walker A and B motifs. We found that HuABCB6 is expressed at low levels in normal human liver. We found that ABCB6 was overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinomas compared to paired surrounding non-malignant tissue. We found that there was no difference in ABCB6 gene copy between human liver cancer and its paired non-malignant tissue. Because HuABCB6 was overexpressed in human cancers compared to peri-tumoral tissue in the absence of gene amplification, transcriptional regulation may play an important role in its expression. Therefore, we isolated a 14 kb genomic DNA clone containing the HuABCB6 promoter and 5'-flanking region. The 5'-flanking region contains a CpG island, lacks an appropriately positioned TATA element and contains a number of putative transcription factor binding sites. Two transcription start sites were identified by S1 nuclease mapping at -274 and -296 bp from the start codon. Transient transfection of the HuABCB6 promoter constructs (HuABCB6/1.68, 1.39, 1.13, 0.90, 0.52) containing the luciferase reporter gene resulted in a 1100-2300-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to the empty vector control whereas HuABCB6/1.68 subcloned in the reverse orientation resulted in no activity. We observed a significant decrease in luciferase activity with the promoter constructs, HuABCB6/0.25, 0.15 and 0.06, which indicates that an orientation-dependent functional promoter is contained within our previously predicted promoter region of -315 bp to -565 bp as deletion of this 250 bp sequence resulted in a loss of promoter activity.

12027893|t|Human sprouty 4, a new ras antagonist on 5q31, interacts with the dual specificity kinase TESK1.
12027893|a|The Drosophila melanogaster protein sprouty is induced upon fibroblast growth factor (FGF)- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor tyrosine kinase activation and acts as an inhibitor of the ras/MAP kinase pathway downstream of these receptors. By differential display RT-PCR of activated vs. resting umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) we detected a new human sprouty gene, which we designated human sprouty 4 (hspry4) based on its homology with murine sprouty 4. Hspry4 is widely expressed and Northern blots indicate that different isoforms of hspry4 are induced upon cellular activation. The hspry4 gene maps to 5q31.3. It encodes a protein of 322 amino acids, which, in support of a modulating role in signal transduction, contains a prototypic cysteine-rich region, three, potentially Src homology 3 (SH3) binding, proline-rich regions and a PEST sequence. This new sprouty orthologue can suppress the insulin- and EGF-receptor transduced MAP kinase signaling pathway, but fails to inhibit MAP kinase activation by constitutively active V12 ras. Hspry4 appears to impair the formation of active GTP-ras and exert its activity at the level of wild-type ras or upstream thereof. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, using hspry4 as bait, testicular protein kinase 1 (TESK1) was identified from a human fetal liver cDNA library as a partner of hspry4. The hspry4-TESK1 interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and increases by growth factor stimulation. The two proteins colocalize in apparent cytoplasmic vesicles and do not show substantial translocation to the plasma membrane upon receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation.

12106695|t|Molecular, functional, and genomic characterization of human KCC2, the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter.
12106695|a|The expression level of the neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 (SLC12A5) is a major determinant of whether neurons will respond to GABA with a depolarizing, excitatory response or a hyperpolarizing, inhibitory response. In view of the potential role in human neuronal excitability we have characterized the hKCC2 cDNA and gene. The 5.9 kb hKCC2 transcript is specific to brain, and is induced during in vitro differentiation of NT2 teratocarcinoma cells into neuronal NT2-N cells. The 24-exon SLC12A5 gene is on human chromosome 20q13, and contains a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat within intron 1 near a potential binding site for neuron-restrictive silencing factor. Expression of hKCC2 cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes results in significant Cl(-)-dependent (86)Rb(+) uptake under isotonic conditions; cell swelling under hypotonic conditions causes a 20-fold activation, which is blocked by the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin-A. In contrast, oocytes expressing mouse KCC4 do not mediate isotonic K-Cl cotransport but express much higher absolute transport activity than KCC2 oocytes under hypotonic conditions. Initial and steady state kinetics of hKCC2-injected oocytes were performed in both isotonic and hypotonic conditions, revealing K(m)s for K(+) and Cl(-) of 9.3+/-1.8 mM and 6.8+/-0.9 mM, respectively; both affinities are significantly higher than KCC1 and KCC4. The K(m) for Cl(-) is close to the intracellular Cl(-) activity of mature neurons, as befits a neuronal efflux mechanism.   Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

12397388|t|K+ channel activation by all three isoforms of serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent protein kinase SGK.
12397388|a|The serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase SGK1 was originally identified as a glucocorticoid-sensitive gene. Subsequently, the two homologous kinases SGK2 and SGK3 have been cloned, being products of distinct genes, which are differentially expressed and share 80% identity in amino acid sequence in their catalytic domains. While SGK1 has been shown to activate ion channels, including K(+) channels, the functions of SGK2 and SGK3 have not been examined. The present study was therefore performed to elucidate the effect of SGK1, SGK2, and SGK3 on electrical properties of renal epithelial cells. To this end human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were transfected with the kinases and ion-channel activity determined using the patch-clamp technique. In non-transfected cells and in cells transfected with the empty GFP construct a voltage-gated K(+) current was observed amounting to 303+/-19 pA ( n=13) and 299+/-29 pA ( n=23), respectively. Transfection with SGK1, SGK2 or SGK3 increased the voltage-gated K(+) current to 1056+/-152 pA ( n=17), 555+/-47 pA ( n=17), and 775+/-98 pA ( n=16), respectively. The K(+) current was fully blocked by 3 mM tetraethylammonium chloride and inhibited 45% by the Kv1 channel blocker margatoxin (10 nM). In dual electrode voltage-clamp experiments SGK isoforms up-regulated Kv1 voltage-gated K(+)channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The present observations thus reveal a powerful stimulating effect of all three isoforms of SGK on K(+) channels. Those effects may participate in regulation of epithelial transport, cell proliferation, and neuromuscular excitability.

12445808|t|Physical interaction between hepatitis C virus NS4B protein and CREB-RP/ATF6beta.
12445808|a|By using a yeast two-hybrid assay, cyclic AMP-response-element-binding protein-related protein (CREB-RP), also called activating transcription factor 6beta (ATF6beta), was identified as a cellular protein that interacts with the NS4B protein of hepatitis C virus. An N-terminal half of NS4B and a central portion of CREB-RP/ATF6beta containing the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain were involved in the interaction. The interaction between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta was demonstrated also in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopic analyses using specific antibodies. The bZIP domain of ATF6alpha, which shares high sequence similarity with CREB-RP/ATF6beta, was also shown to interact with NS4B in yeast although the interaction was weaker than that between NS4B and CREB-RP/ATF6beta. CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha are known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced transcription factors. Collectively, our results imply the possibility that NS4B modulates certain cellular responses upon ER stress through the physical interaction with CREB-RP/ATF6beta and ATF6alpha.

12466223|t|Nociceptive sensitization by the secretory protein Bv8.
12466223|a|1 The small protein Bv8, isolated from amphibian skin, belongs to a novel family of secretory proteins (Bv8-Prokineticin family, SWISS-PROT: Q9PW66) whose orthologues have been conserved throughout evolution, from invertebrates to humans. 2 When injected intravenously or subcutaneously (from 0.06 to 500 pmol kg(-1)) or intrathecally (from 6 fmol to 250 pmol) in rats, Bv8 produced an intense systemic nociceptive sensitization to mechanical and thermal stimuli applied to the tail and paws. 3 Topically delivered into one rat paw, 50 fmol of Bv8 decreased by 50% the nociceptive threshold to pressure in the injected paw without affecting the threshold in the contralateral paw. 4 The two G-protein coupled prokineticin receptors, PK-R1 and PK-R2, were expressed in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and in dorsal quadrants of spinal cord (DSC) and bound Bv8 and the mammalian orthologue, EG-VEGF, with high affinity. In DSC, PK-R1 was more abundant than PK-R2, whereas both receptors were equally expressed in DRG. IC(50) of Bv8 and EG-VEGF to inhibit -Bv8 binding to rat DRG and DSC were 4.1+/-0.4 nM Bv8 and 76.4+/-7.6 nM EG-VEGF, in DRG; 7.3+/-0.9 nM Bv8 and 330+/-41 nM EG-VEGF, in DSC. 5 In the small diameter neurons (<30 microm) of rat DRG cultures, Bv8 concentrations, ranging from 0.2 to 10 nM, raised (i) in a dose-dependent manner. 6 These data suggest that Bv8, through binding to PK receptors of DSC and primary sensitive neurons, results in intense sensitization of peripheral nociceptors to thermal and mechanical stimuli.

12504588|t|Robo1 and Robo2 are homophilic binding molecules that promote axonal growth.
12504588|a|In the present study we show that following transfection in 3T3 cells, human Robo1 and Robo2 stimulate neurite outgrowth from Robo-positive neurons (retinal neurons and olfactory neurons), but have no effect on Robo-negative neurons (cerebellar granule cells). The neurite outgrowth response was inhibited by an antibody raised against the first Ig domain of Robo1/2 or by soluble Robo-Fc chimera. Furthermore, we show that the extracellular domains of Robo1 and Robo2 are homophilic adhesion molecules that can also interact with each other. These data suggest a wider range of functions for the Robo family in the development of the nervous system and provide novel insights into the molecular basis for the phenotypes observed in Robo mutants in Drosophila, C. elegans, and zebrafish.

12728244|t|The AVIT protein family. Secreted cysteine-rich vertebrate proteins with diverse functions.
12728244|a|Homologues of a protein originally isolated from snake venom and frog skin secretions are present in many vertebrate species. They contain 80-90 amino acids, 10 of which are cysteines with identical spacing. Various names have been given to these proteins, such as mamba intestinal protein 1 (MIT1), Bv8 (Bombina variegata molecular mass approximately 8 kDa), prokineticins and endocrine-gland vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF). Their amino-terminal sequences are identical, and so we propose that the sequence of their first four residues, AVIT, is used as a name for this family. From a comparison of the sequences, two types of AVIT proteins can be discerned. These proteins seem to be distributed widely in mammalian tissues and are known to bind to G-protein-coupled receptors. Members of this family have been shown to stimulate contraction of the guinea pig ileum, to cause hyperalgesia after injection into rats and to be active as specific growth factors. Moreover, the messenger RNA level of one of these AVIT proteins changes rhythmically in the region of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This shows that members of this new family of small proteins are involved in diverse biological processes.

12862317|t|Expression and localization of VCX/Y proteins and their possible involvement in regulation of ribosome assembly during spermatogenesis.
12862317|a|Variable Charge X/Y (VCX/Y) is a human testis-specific gene family that localized on X and Y chromosomes. In this study, VCY protein was expressed in E. coli in the form of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. With the purified fusion protein as antigen, the anti-GST-VCY antibody was generated and the localization of VCY protein in human testis was determined by immunohistochemistry. In the testis seminiferous epithelium, VCY proteins were highly expressed in nuclei of germ cells. Using propidium iodide staining and green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag technologies, VCY and VCX-8r proteins were mainly localized in the nucleoli of COS7 cells. In addition, the colocalization for VCY and VCX-8r in COS7 cells was also observed. With VCY cDNA as bait, a cDNA fragment of acidic ribosomal protein PO was obtained using yeast two-hybrid system. All the information above indicates that VCX/Y protein family might be involved in the regulation of ribosome assembly during spermatogenesis.

14525983|t|DACH1 inhibits transforming growth factor-beta signaling through binding Smad4.
14525983|a|The vertebrate homologues of Drosophila dachsund, DACH1 and DACH2, have been implicated as important regulatory genes in development. DACH1 plays a role in retinal and pituitary precursor cell proliferation and DACH2 plays a specific role in myogenesis. DACH proteins contain a domain (DS domain) that is conserved with the proto-oncogenes Ski and Sno. Since the Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes repress AP-1 and SMAD signaling, we hypothesized that DACH1 might play a similar cellular function. Herein, DACH1 was found to be expressed in breast cancer cell lines and to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced apoptosis. DACH1 repressed TGF-beta induction of AP-1 and Smad signaling in gene reporter assays and repressed endogenous TGF-beta-responsive genes by microarray analyses. DACH1 bound to endogenous NCoR and Smad4 in cultured cells and DACH1 co-localized with NCoR in nuclear dotlike structures. NCoR enhanced DACH1 repression, and the repression of TGF-beta-induced AP-1 or Smad signaling by DACH1 required the DACH1 DS domain. The DS domain of DACH was sufficient for NCoR binding at a Smad4-binding site. Smad4 was required for DACH1 repression of Smad signaling. In Smad4 null HTB-134 cells, DACH1 inhibited the activation of SBE-4 reporter activity induced by Smad2 or Smad3 only in the presence of Smad4. DACH1 participates in the negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling by interacting with NCoR and Smad4.

14576168|t|A mammalian homolog of Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional coactivator intersex is a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex.
14576168|a|The multiprotein Mediator complex is a coactivator required for transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase II transcribed genes by DNA binding transcription factors. We previously partially purified a Med8-containing Mediator complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C. S., Sato, S., Tomomori-Sato, C., Kamura, T., Pause, A., Stearman, R., Klausner, R. D., Malik, S., Lane, W. S., Sorokina, I., Roeder, R. G., Conaway, J. W., and Conaway, R. C. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 10353-10358). Analysis of proteins present in the most highly enriched Mediator fractions by tandem mass spectrometry led to the identification of several new mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as several potential Mediator subunits. Here we identify one of these proteins, encoded by the previously uncharacterized AK000411 open reading frame, as a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The AK000411 protein, which we designate hIntersex (human Intersex), shares significant sequence similarity with the Drosophila melanogaster intersex protein, which has functional properties expected of a transcriptional coactivator specific for the Drosophila doublesex transactivator. In addition, we show that hIntersex assembles into a subcomplex with Mediator subunits p28b and TRFP. Taken together, our findings identify a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator and shed new light on the architecture of the mammalian Mediator complex.

14595443|t|The netrin-G1 ligand NGL-1 promotes the outgrowth of thalamocortical axons.
14595443|a|Netrin-G1 is a lipid-anchored protein that is structurally related to the netrin family of axon guidance molecules. Netrin-G1 does not bind any of the known netrin receptors and its function is not known. Here we identify human netrin-G1 ligand (NGL-1), a transmembrane protein containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) domains that specifically interacts with netrin-G1 through its LRR region. Whereas netrin-G1 is expressed highly in mouse thalamic axons, NGL-1 is most abundant in the striatum and the cerebral cortex--the intermediate and final targets, respectively, of thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Surface-bound NGL-1 stimulates, but soluble NGL-1 disrupts, the growth of embryonic thalamic axons, and in vitro data indicate that NGL-1 activity may be mediated at least partially by netrin-G1. Our findings provide evidence that netrin-G1 functions as an important component of the NGL-1 receptor to promote TCA outgrowth and that membrane-bound netrins can participate in receiving axonal signaling pathways.

14603251|t|TACC1-chTOG-Aurora A protein complex in breast cancer.
14603251|a|The three human TACC (transforming acidic coiled-coil) genes encode a family of proteins with poorly defined functions that are suspected to play a role in oncogenesis. A Xenopus TACC homolog called Maskin is involved in translational control, while Drosophila D-TACC interacts with the microtubule-associated protein MSPS (Mini SPindleS) to ensure proper dynamics of spindle pole microtubules during cell division. We have delineated here the interactions of TACC1 with four proteins, namely the microtubule-associated chTOG (colonic and hepatic tumor-overexpressed gene) protein (ortholog of Drosophila MSPS), the adaptor protein TRAP (tudor repeat associator with PCTAIRE2), the mitotic serine/threonine kinase Aurora A and the mRNA regulator LSM7 (Like-Sm protein 7). To measure the relevance of the TACC1-associated complex in human cancer we have examined the expression of the three TACC, chTOG and Aurora A in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. We show that expressions of TACC1, TACC2, TACC3 and Aurora A are significantly correlated and downregulated in a subset of breast tumors. Using siRNAs, we further show that depletion of chTOG and, to a lesser extent of TACC1, perturbates cell division. We propose that TACC proteins, which we also named 'Taxins', control mRNA translation and cell division in conjunction with microtubule organization and in association with chTOG and Aurora A, and that these complexes and cell processes may be affected during mammary gland oncogenesis.

14990717|t|US11 of herpes simplex virus type 1 interacts with HIPK2 and antagonizes HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest.
14990717|a|Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a nuclear serine/threonine kinase of the subfamily of dual-specificity Yak1-related kinase proteins. HIPK2 was first described as a homeodomain-interacting protein kinase acting as a corepressor for homeodomain transcription factors. More recently, it was reported that HIPK2 plays a role in p53-mediated cellular apoptosis and could also participate in the regulation of the cell cycle. US11 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of several processes related to the survival of cells submitted to environmental stresses by mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. In an attempt to better understand the multiple functions of US11, we identified cellular binding partners of this protein by using the yeast two-hybrid system. We report that US11 interacts with HIPK2 through the PEST domain of HIPK2 and that this interaction occurs also in human cells. This interaction modifies the subcellular distribution of HIPK2 and protects the cell against the HIPK2-induced cell growth arrest.

1833184|t|A novel IL-1 receptor, cloned from B cells by mammalian expression, is expressed in many cell types.
1833184|a|cDNA clones corresponding to an Mr approximately 80,000 receptor (type I receptor) for interleukin-1 (IL-1) have been isolated previously by mammalian expression. Here, we report the use of an improved expression cloning method to isolate human and murine cDNA clones encoding a second type (Mr approximately 60,000) of IL-1 receptor (type II receptor). The mature type II IL-1 receptor consists of (i) a ligand binding portion comprised of three immunoglobulin-like domains; (ii) a single transmembrane region; and (iii) a short cytoplasmic domain of 29 amino acids. This last contrasts with the approximately 215 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the type I receptor, and suggests that the two IL-1 receptors may interact with different signal transduction pathways. The type II receptor is expressed in a number of different tissues, including both B and T lymphocytes, and can be induced in several cell types by treatment with phorbol ester. Both IL-1 receptors appear to be well conserved in evolution, and map to the same chromosomal location. Like the type I receptor, the human type II IL-1 receptor can bind all three forms of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1ra). Vaccinia virus contains an open reading frame bearing strong resemblance to the type II IL-1 receptor.

8537117|t|Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones for Humly9: the human homologue of mouse Ly9.
8537117|a|Ly9 is a mouse cell membrane antigen found on all lymphocytes and coded for by a gene that maps to chromosome 1. We previously described the isolation and characterization of a full-length cDNA clone for mouse Ly9. Using cross-species hybridization we isolated cDNA clones encoding the human homologue Humly9. Analysis of the predicted protein sequence suggests that the extra-cellular portion of the Humly9 molecules is composed of four Ig-like domains: a V domain (V) without disulphide bonds and a truncated C2 domain (tC2) with two disulphide bonds, a second V domain without disulphide bonds and a second tC2 with two disulphide bonds, i.e., as V-tC2-V-tC2. The gene encoding Humly9 was mapped to chromosome 1 by analysis of human/hamster hybrids, and more specifically to the 1q22 region by in situ hybridization. The protein sequence data support the view that Humly9 belongs to the immunoglobulin-superfamily subgroup which includes CD48, CD2, and LFA-3.

8606489|t|SM-20 is a novel 40-kd protein whose expression in the arterial wall is restricted to smooth muscle.
8606489|a|We have previously reported the identification of a novel cDNA, SM-20, whose corresponding mRNA levels are regulated by growth factors in rat aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) culture. Affinity-purified polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were made against a 230 amino acid region of the SM-20 putative peptide expressed in the bacterial vector, pET-3b. Western blot analyses of rat and human SMC lysates detected a single protein species of approximately 40 kd. SM-20 was not detected in concentrates of the culture medium. By immunohistochemistry, SM-20 was localized to filaments in the cytoplasm of cultured SMC. Like SM-20 mRNA, levels of SM-20 protein were increased 1-3 hours after serum stimulation of rat aortic SMC. In rat tissues, SM-20 antigen was detected in abundance in smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle. SM-20 was also detected in some epithelial cells of the kidney, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, but was not found in the parenchyma of the liver, spleen, or testis. In the rat arterial wall, SM-20 antigen was restricted to the SMC of the media and, after balloon arterial injury, was found most abundantly in the neointima. In human atherosclerotic coronary arteries, SM-20 antigen predominated in the SMC of the intimal plaques and was not detected in macrophages, endothelium, or adventitial cells. Thus, SM-20 encodes a protein which serves as a novel SMC-specific marker within the vessel wall.

8702627|t|Prk, a cytokine-inducible human protein serine/threonine kinase whose expression appears to be down-regulated in lung carcinomas.
8702627|a|We have cloned and characterized a putative protein serine/threonine kinase termed prk through a combination of polymerase chain reaction and conventional cDNA library screening approaches. There are apparently two distinct domains within prk protein deduced from its nucleotide sequences. The amino-terminal portion has the feature of the catalytic domain of a serine/threonine kinase and shows strong homology to mouse fnk and other polo family kinases including mouse snk, human and murine plk, Drosophila polo, and yeast Cdc5. The carboxyl-terminal portion, presumably the regulatory domain, shares extensive homology to mouse fnk. Northern blotting analyses reveal that prk expression is restricted to a very limited number of tissues with placenta, ovaries, and lung containing detectable amounts of prk mRNA. prk mRNA expression is also detected at a low level in the megakaryocytic cell line Dami, MO7e, and three brain glioma cell lines. In addition, refeeding of serum-deprived MO7e, Dami, and K562 cells of hematopoietic origin and GMOO637D of lung fibroblasts rapidly activates prk mRNA expression with its peak induction around 2 h after serum addition. prk gene activation by the serum requires no new protein synthesis. The recombinant cytokines such as interleukin-3 and thrombopoietin also activate prk mRNA expression in MO7e cells. Furthermore, a survey of RNAs isolated from the tumor and the uninvolved tissues from 18 lung cancer patients reveals that prk mRNA expression is significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues. Southern blotting analysis indicates that the prk gene is present in a single copy in the genome of tumors and normal cells. Taken together, these results suggest that prk expression may be restricted to proliferating cells and involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression. The molecular cloning of prk cDNA will facilitate the study of its biological role as well as its potential role in tumorigenesis.

8938450|t|Assignment of the PSST subunit gene of human mitochondrial complex I to chromosome 19p13.
8938450|a|The cDNA for the PSST subunit of human mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH): ubiquinone oxidoreductase  was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of human cDNA. The sequence of the mature protein deduced from the cDNA codes for a protein that is closely related to the bovine protein (93% homology). Nine conservative substitutions are found in the mature protein, mainly in the N and C terminal regions. The mature human protein is missing four amino acids (PAAL) close to the N terminus that are present in the bovine protein. The N terminus of the mature protein is preceded by a presequence of 38 amino acids that, although quite different from its bovine counterpart (52% homology), has properties that are characteristic of a mitochondrial import sequence. Southern hybridization analysis predicts an estimated gene size of 3.8 kb. Northern hybridization analysis of mRNA from fibroblasts of complex I-deficient patients revealed no size or transcript level abnormalities. The cDNA of the PSST protein was used to investigate tissue-specific expression and to localize the gene for this subunit to chromosome 19p13.

9171375|t|Three human RNA polymerase III-specific subunits form a subcomplex with a selective function in specific transcription initiation.
9171375|a|Transcription by RNA polymerase III involves recruitment of the polymerase by template-bound accessory factors, followed by initiation, elongation, and termination steps. An immunopurification approach has been used to demonstrate that human RNA Pol III is composed of 16 subunits, some of which are apparently modified in HeLa cells. Partial denaturing conditions and sucrose gradient sedimentation at high salt result in the dissociation of a subcomplex that includes hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62. Cognate cDNAs were isolated and shown to encode three subunits that are specific to RNA Pol III and homologous to three yeast subunits. The human RNA Pol III core lacking the subcomplex functions in transcription elongation and termination following nonspecific initiation on a tailed template, but fails to show promoter-dependent transcription initiation in conjunction with accessory factors. The capability for specific transcription initiation can be restored either by the natural subcomplex or by a stable subcomplex composed of recombinant hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62 polypeptides. One component (hRPC39) of this subcomplex interacts physically with both hTBP and hTFIIIB90, two subunits of human RNA Pol III transcription initiation factor IIIB. These data strongly suggest that the hRPC32-hRPC39-hRPC62 subcomplex directs RNA Pol III binding to the TFIIIB-DNA complex via the interactions between TFIIIB and hRPC39.

9223106|t|Presenilin 1 interaction in the brain with a novel member of the Armadillo family.
9223106|a|One approach to understanding the function of presenilin 1 (PS1), is to discover those proteins with which it interacts. Evidence for a function in developmental patterning came from C. elegans, in which a PS homologue was identified by screening for suppressors of a mutation in Notch/lin-12, a gene which specifies cell fate. However, this genetic experiment cannot determine which proteins directly interact with PS1. Therefore, we utilized the two hybrid system and confirmatory co-immunoprecipitations to identify a novel catenin, termed delta-catenin, which interacts with PS1 and is principally expressed in brain. The catenins are a gene family related to the Armadillo gene in Drosophila, some of which appear to have dual roles-they are components of cell-cell adherens junctions, and may serve as intermediates in the Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway, which, like Notch/lin-12, is also responsible for a variety of inductive signaling events. In the non-neuronal 293 cell line, PS1 interacted with beta-catenin, the family member with the greatest homology to Armadillo. Wg and Notch interactions are mediated by the Dishevelled gene, which may form a signaling complex with PS1 and Wg pathway intermediates to regulate the function of the Notch/lin-12 gene.

9234719|t|A transcriptional mediator protein that is required for activation of many RNA polymerase II promoters and is conserved from yeast to humans.
9234719|a|A temperature-sensitive mutation was obtained in Med6p, a component of the mediator complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mediator complex has been shown to enable transcriptional activation in vitro. This mutation in Med6p abolished activation of transcription from four of five inducible promoters tested in vivo. There was no effect, however, on uninduced transcription, transcription of constitutively expressed genes, or transcription by RNA polymerases I and III. Mediator-RNA polymerase II complex isolated from the mutant yeast strain was temperature sensitive for transcriptional activation in a reconstituted in vitro system due to a defect in initiation complex formation. A database search revealed the existence of MED6-related genes in humans and Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that the role of mediator in transcriptional activation is conserved throughout the evolution.

9315665|t|Isolation and functional analysis of a cDNA for human Jagged2, a gene encoding a ligand for the Notch1 receptor.
9315665|a|Signaling through Notch receptors has been implicated in the control of cellular differentiation in animals ranging from nematodes to humans. Starting from a human expressed sequence tag-containing sequence resembling that of Serrate, the gene for a ligand of Drosophila melanogaster Notch, we assembled a full-length cDNA, now called human Jagged2, from overlapping cDNA clones. The full-length cDNA encodes a polypeptide having extensive sequence homology to Serrate (40.6% identity and 58.7% similarity) and even greater homology to several putative mammalian Notch ligands that have subsequently been described. When in situ hybridization was performed, expression of the murine Jagged2 homolog was found to be highest in fetal thymus, epidermis, foregut, dorsal root ganglia, and inner ear. In Northern blot analysis of RNA from tissues of 2-week-old mice, the 5.0-kb Jagged2 transcript was most abundant in heart, lung, thymus, skeletal muscle, brain, and testis. Immunohistochemistry revealed coexpression of Jagged2 and Notch1 within thymus and other fetal murine tissues, consistent with interaction of the two proteins in vivo. Coculture of fibroblasts expressing human Jagged2 with murine C2C12 myoblasts inhibited myogenic differentiation, accompanied by increased Notch1 and the appearance of a novel 115-kDa Notch1 fragment. Exposure of C2C12 cells to Jagged2 led to increased amounts of Notch mRNA as well as mRNAs for a second Notch receptor, Notch3, and a second Notch ligand, Jagged1. Constitutively active forms of Notchl in C2C12 cells also induced increased levels of the same set of mRNAs, suggesting positive feedback control of these genes initiated by binding of Jagged2 to Notch1. This feedback control may function in vivo to coordinate differentiation across certain groups of progenitor cells adopting identical cell fates.

9368056|t|Isolation and characterization of a novel ligand-dependent thyroid hormone receptor-coactivating protein.
9368056|a|The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) regulates the expression of target genes upon binding to triiodothyronine (T3) response elements. In the presence of T3, the TR recruits coactivating proteins that both modulate and integrate the ligand response. We report here the cloning of a novel protein using the TR ligand-binding domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Analysis of a putative full-length clone demonstrates a cDNA sequence that encodes a protein of 920 amino acids with a size of 120 kDa (p120). Alignment with known sequences shows homology to a previously identified protein of unknown function, termed skeletal muscle abundant protein. Interaction studies demonstrate that p120 interacts with the TR AF-2 domain in the presence of ligand through a 111-amino acid region. Northern analysis demonstrates widespread expression in human tissues. Cotransfection assays in CV-1 cells demonstrate that p120 enhances TR-mediated transactivation on multiple T3 response elements in the presence of T3. In addition, CREB-binding protein synergizes with p120 to enhance this effect. When linked to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, p120 is an activator of transcription alone. Thus, p120 satisfies a number of important criteria as a nuclear receptor coactivator.

9451016|a|The gene for the human dolichol cycle GlcNAc-1-P transferase (ALG7/GPT) was cloned by screening a human lung fibroblast cDNA library. The library was constructed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector, and the positive clone was identified by complementation of the conditional lethal S.cerevisiae strain YPH-A7-GAL. This strain was constructed by replacing the endogenous promoter of the GPT-gene by the stringently regulated GAL1-promoter. This construct allows to specifically suppress the endogenous enzyme activity. The insert of the positive clone displayed an open reading frame of 1200 nucleotides, coding for a putative protein of 400 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 44.7 kDa. The deduced protein sequence shows a homology of over 90% when compared with other mammalian GPT sequences, thus resembling the close phylogenetic relationship between mammalian species. This homology however decreases to 40-50% when compared to more distantly related organisms such as S.cerevisiae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe , or Leishmania amazonensis . Biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein showed that it is functionally expressed in the S.cerevisiae strain YPH-A7-GAL. GlcNAc- and GlcNAc2-PP-Dolichol biosynthesis could be shown with isolated S.cerevisiae membranes from cells harboring the recombinant plasmid and grown on glucose thus suppressing transcription of the endogenous gene. Synthesis could be stimulated by dolicholphosphate and was inhibited by tunicamycin. These results show that we have cloned the human GlcNAc-1-P transferase by heterologous complementation in S. cerevisiae, a strategy that may be useful for the cloning and characterization of glycosyltransferases from a variety of organisms.

9462743|t|Mutations in PROP1 cause familial combined pituitary hormone deficiency.
9462743|a|Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) in man denotes impaired production of growth hormone (GH) and one or more of the other five anterior pituitary hormones. Mutations of the pituitary transcription factor gene POU1F1 (the human homologue of mouse Pit1) are responsible for deficiencies of GH, prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in Snell and Jackson dwarf mice and in man, while the production of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is preserved. The Ames dwarf (df) mouse displays a similar phenotype, and appears to be epistatic to Snell and Jackson dwarfism. We have recently positionally cloned the putative Ames dwarf gene Prop1, which encodes a paired-like homeodomain protein that is expressed specifically in embryonic pituitary and is necessary for Pit1 expression. In this report, we have identified four CPHD families with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for inactivating mutations of PROP1. These mutations in the human PROP1 gene result in a gene product with reduced DNA-binding and transcriptional activation ability in comparison to the product of the murine df mutation. In contrast to individuals with POU1F1 mutations, those with PROP1 mutations cannot produce LH and FSH at a sufficient level and do not enter puberty spontaneously. Our results identify a major cause of CPHD in humans and suggest a direct or indirect role for PROP1 in the ontogenesis of pituitary gonadotropes, as well as somatotropes, lactotropes and caudomedial thyrotropes.

9479505|t|Discovery of three novel G-protein-coupled receptor genes.
9479505|a|We report here the molecular cloning, tissue distribution, and chromosomal localization of novel genes encoding G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A search of a mouse database of expressed sequence tags revealed an EST partially encoding a GPCR, which was used to screen a mouse genomic library to obtain the translational open reading frame (ORF). The resultant clone, GPR27, contained an intronless ORF, encoding a receptor of 379 amino acids. In an alternate strategy, human genomic DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, using degenerate oligonucleotides based on GPR1. Two PCR products partially encoding GPCRs were isolated and used to screen a genomic library to obtain the translational ORF. One of the resultant clones, GPR30, contained an intronless ORF encoding a receptor of 375 amino acids. The other clone, GPR35, also contained an intronless ORF encoding a receptor of 309 amino acids. Transcripts corresponding to GPR27 and GPR30 were detected in several areas of human and rat CNS, While GPR35 expression was detected only in the rat intestine. Through fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis the gene encoding GPR30 was localized to chromosome 7p22 and GPR35 to chromosome 2q37.3.

9482110|t|The C-terminus of the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein mediates interaction with the PDZ domain of cellular proteins.
9482110|a|Infection by HTLV-1 has been correlated with the appearance of various proliferative or degenerative diseases. Some of these disorders have been observed in transgenic mice expressing the Tax protein, which is known to transactivate various viral and cellular promoters through interactions with several transcription factors. In this study we show that the C-terminus of this viral oncoprotein represents a motif permitting binding of Tax to the PDZ domains of several cellular proteins. A two-hybrid screen with Tax as bait indeed yielded complementary DNAs coding for six proteins including PDZ domains. Two of them correspond to truncated forms of the PSD-95 and beta1-syntrophin proteins, another clone codes for a protein homologous to the product of the C. elegans gene lin-7. The other three clones code for new human members of the PDZ family of cellular proteins. The interaction of Tax with the products of these clones was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, and analysis of various mutants of Tax established the importance of the C-terminal amino acids for several of these interactions. These data suggest that Tax could perturb the normal function of targeted cellular proteins by strongly interacting with their PDZ domains.

9548260|t|Interaction of polyadenylate-binding protein with the eIF4G homologue PAIP enhances translation.
9548260|a|In the initiation of translation in eukaryotes, binding of the small ribosomal subunit to the messenger RNA results from recognition of the 5' cap structure (m7GpppX) of the mRNA by the cap-binding complex eIF4F. eIF4F is itself a three-subunit complex comprising the cap-binding protein eIF4E, eIF4A, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, and eIF4G, which interacts with both eIF4A and eIF4E and enhances cap binding by eIF4E. The mRNA 3' polyadenylate tail and the associated poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) also regulate translational initiation, probably by interacting with the 5' end of the mRNA. In yeast and plants, PABP interacts with eIF4G but no such interaction has been reported in mammalian cells. Here, we describe a new human PABP-interacting protein, PAIP-I, whose sequence is similar to the central portion of eIF4G and which interacts with eIF4A. Overexpression of PAIP-1 in COS-7 cells stimulates translation, perhaps by providing a physical link between the mRNA termini.

9563500|t|Homology between a human apoptosis specific protein and the product of APG5, a gene involved in autophagy in yeast.
9563500|a|Apoptosis specific proteins (ASP) are expressed in the cytoplasm of cultured mammalian cells of various lineages following induction of apoptosis. The cDNA encoding ASP has been cloned from a human expression library and has significant homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae APG5 gene which is essential for yeast autophagy. The ASP gene, known as hAPG5, can be transcribed to give mRNAs of 3.3 kbp, 2.5 kbp and 1.8 kbp which are present at comparable levels in viable and apoptotic cells, demonstrating that protein expression must be regulated at the translational level. These data indicate a possible relationship between apoptosis and autophagy and suggest evolutionary conservation in mammalian apoptosis of a degradative process present in yeast.

9590290|t|Mutations in the human alpha-tectorin gene cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment.
9590290|a|The tectorial membrane is an extracellular matrix of the inner ear that contacts the stereocilia bundles of specialized sensory hair cells. Sound induces movement of these hair cells relative to the tectorial membrane, deflects the stereocilia, and leads to fluctuations in hair-cell membrane potential, transducing sound into electrical signals. Alpha-tectorin is one of the major non-collagenous components of the tectorial membrane. Recently, the gene encoding mouse alpha-tectorin (Tecta) was mapped to a region of mouse chromosome 9, which shows evolutionary conservation with human chromosome 11q (ref. 3), where linkage was found in two families, one Belgian (DFNA12; ref. 4) and the other, Austrian (DFNA8; unpublished data), with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment. We determined the complete sequence and the intron-exon structure of the human TECTA gene. In both families, mutation analysis revealed missense mutations which replace conserved amino-acid residues within the zona pellucida domain of TECTA. These findings indicate that mutations in TECTA are responsible for hearing impairment in these families, and implicate a new type of protein in the pathogenesis of hearing impairment.

9620774|t|A novel homeobox gene PITX3 is mutated in families with autosomal-dominant cataracts and ASMD.
9620774|a|We report here the identification of a new human homeobox gene, PITX3, and its involvement in anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis (ASMD) and congenital cataracts in humans. The PITX3 gene is the human homologue of the mouse Pitx3 gene and is a member of the RIEG/PITX homeobox gene family. The protein encoded by PITX3 shows 99% amino-acid identity to the mouse protein, with 100% identity in the homeodomain and approximately 70% overall identity to other members of this family. We mapped the human PITX3 gene to 10q25 using a radiation-hybrid panel. A collection of 80 DNA samples from individuals with various eye anomalies was screened for mutations in the PITX3 gene. We identified two mutations in independent patients. A 17-bp insertion in the 3'-end of the coding sequence, resulting in a frame shift, occurred in a patient with ASMD and cataracts, and a G-->A substitution, changing a codon for serine into a codon for asparagine, in the 5'-end of the gene occurred in a patient with congenital cataracts. Both mutations cosegregate with the disease phenotype in families, and neither were found in up to 300 control individuals studied. Further expression analysis of Pitx3 in the mouse supports a unique role in early ocular development, with later expression extending to the midbrain, tongue, incisors, sternum, vertebrae and limbs. These data strongly suggest a role for PITX3 in ASMD and cataracts and provide new evidence of the contribution of the RIEG/PITX gene family to the developmental program underpinning normal eye formation.

9637683|t|A stress response pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus requires a novel bifunctional protein kinase/endoribonuclease (Ire1p) in mammalian cells.
9637683|a|Eukaryotes respond to the presence of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by up-regulating the transcription of genes encoding ER protein chaperones, such as BiP. We have isolated a novel human cDNA encoding a homolog to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ire1p, a proximal sensor for this signal transduction pathway in yeast. The gene product hIre1p is a type 1 transmembrane protein containing a cytoplasmic domain that is highly conserved to the yeast counterpart having a Ser/Thr protein kinase domain and a domain homologous to RNase L. However, the luminal domain has extensively diverged from the yeast gene product. hIre1p expressed in mammalian cells displayed intrinsic autophosphorylation activity and an endoribonuclease activity that cleaved the 5' splice site of yeast HAC1 mRNA, a substrate for the endoribonuclease activity of yeast Ire1p. Overexpressed hIre1p was localized to the ER with particular concentration around the nuclear envelope and some colocalization with the nuclear pore complex. Expression of Ire1p mRNA was autoregulated through a process that required a functional hIre1p kinase activity. Finally, overexpression of wild-type hIre1p constitutively activated a reporter gene under transcriptional control of the rat BiP promoter, whereas expression of a catalytically inactive hIre1p acted in a trans-dominant-negative manner to prevent transcriptional activation of the BiP promoter in response to ER stress induced by inhibition of N-linked glycosylation. These results demonstrate that hIre1p is an essential proximal sensor of the unfolded protein response pathway in mammalian cells.

9647766|t|cDNA sequence and chromosomal localization of the remaining three human nuclear encoded iron sulphur protein (IP) subunits of complex I: the human IP fraction is completed.
9647766|a|NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be fragmented in a flavoprotein (FP), iron-sulfur protein (IP), and hydrophobic protein (HP) subfraction. The IP subfraction is hypothesized to be significant, since it contains important prosthetic groups highly conserved among species. We cloned the cDNA of three remaining human NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits of this IP fraction: the NDUFS2 (49 kDa), NDUFS3 (30 kDa), and NDUFS6 (13 kDa) subunits. All presented cDNAs include the complete open reading frame (ORF), which consist of 1392, 795, and 375 base pairs, coding for 463, 264, and 124 amino acids, respectively. The latter show 96, 90, and 83% homology with the corresponding bovine translation products. The 3' untranslated regions (UTR) are complete in all three cDNAs. Polymerase chain reaction performed with DNA isolated from somatic human-rodent cell hybrids containing defined human chromosomes as template gave a human-specific signal which mapped the NDUFS2 and NDUFS3 subunits to chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively. In the case of the NDUFS6 subunit a pseudogene may be present since signals were seen in the lanes containing chromosomes 5 and 6. The NDUFS2 contains a highly conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation site and the NDUFS3 subunit contains a highly conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site which make them strong candidates for future mutation detection studies in enzymatic complex I-deficient patients.

9651585|t|SAP30, a novel protein conserved between human and yeast, is a component of a histone deacetylase complex.
9651585|a|Histone acetylation plays a key role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Recently, histone acetylation and deacetylation were found to be catalyzed by structurally distinct, multisubunit complexes that mediate, respectively, activation and repression of transcription. Here, we identify SAP30 as a novel component of the human histone deacetylase complex that includes Sin3, the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, histone binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48, as well as other polypeptides. Moreover, we describe a SAP30 homolog in yeast that is functionally related to Sin3 and the histone deacetylase Rpd3. The human SAP30 complex is active in deacetylating core histone octamers, but inactive in deacetylating nucleosomal histones due to the inability of the histone binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 to gain access to nucleosomal histones. These results define SAP30 as a component of a histone deacetylase complex conserved among eukaryotic organisms.

9694715|t|A novel human actin-binding protein homologue that binds to platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha.
9694715|a|Glycoprotein (GP)Ib-IX-V is one of the major transmembrane complexes present on the platelet surface. Its extracellular domain binds von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin, while its intracellular domain associates tightly with the cytoskeleton through the actin-binding protein (ABP)-280, also known as filamin. In the present study, a full-length cDNA coding for a human ABP homologue has been cloned and sequenced. This protein was identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening procedure via its interaction with the intracellular domain of GPIbalpha. Initially, a 1.3-kb partial cDNA was isolated from a megakaryocyte-like cell line (K562) cDNA library followed by a full-length cDNA of 9.4 kb that was identified in a human placenta library. The full-length cDNA encoded a protein of 2,578 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 276 kD (ABP-276). The amino terminal 248 amino acids contained an apparent actin binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats each containing about 96 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of the protein shared a high degree of homology with human endothelial ABP-280 (70% identity) and chicken filamin (83% identity). However, the 32 amino acid Hinge I region in ABP-280 that contains a calpain cleavage site conferring flexibility on the molecule, was absent in the homologue. An isoform containing a 24 amino acid insertion with a unique sequence at the missing Hinge I region was also identified (ABP-278). This isoform resulted from alternative RNA splicing. ABP-276 and/or ABP-278 were present in all tissues examined, but the relative amount varied in that some tissue contained both forms, while other tissue contained predominately one or the other.

9721204|t|New eukaryotic semaphorins with close homology to semaphorins of DNA viruses.
9721204|a|Semaphorins were initially described as a family of repulsive guidance molecules in embryonal development. Their basic structure consists of an N-terminal signal sequence, the defining semaphorin domain ofapproximately 500 amino acids, an Ig-like domain,and a variable carboxy-terminus. We recently described a viral semaphorin homologue encoded by the alcelaphine herpesvirus type 1. Less conserved, truncated homologues were also identified in poxviruses. Here we describe new human and murine semaphorin homologues. The respective genes were cloned and sequenced, and they were termed H-Sema-L and M-Sema-L (HGMW-approved symbols SEMAL and Semal, respectively). A multiply spliced mRNA of 3.2 kb is expressed in human placenta, spleen, thymus, and gonadal tissue. H-Sema-L maps to chromosome 15q22.3-q23 and M-Sema-L to the homologous locus 9A3.3-B in the mouse genome. The expression patterns and the presence of related genes in large DNA viruses suggest that this new semaphorin has a relevant function in the immune system.   Copyright 1998 Academic Press.

9731181|t|ZK1, a novel Kr ppel-type zinc finger gene, is induced following exposure to ionizing radiation and enhances apoptotic cell death on hematopoietic cells.
9731181|a|To identify and early response factor by exposure to ionizing radiation, we cloned the cDNA of a novel Kr ppel-type zinc finger (ZNF) gene, ZK1, from a cDNA library constructed from the human leukemia cell line, CMK86, using degenerate primers. This cDNA encoded a protein of 671 amino acids with an A box of Kr ppel-associated box (KRAB) domain at the N-terminus, followed by 15 ZNF motifs. The expression level of the ZK1 mRNA in human leukemia cells lines, CMK86 and U937, was increased after exposure to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, murine myeloid precursor 32D cells that were stably transfected with ZK1 cDNA had higher sensitivity to ionizing radiation than the 32D parent cells. These data suggest that the ZK1 gene is one of early response genes by exposure to ionizing radiation, and may have some functions on radiation-induced apoptotic cell death on hematopoietic cells.

9774969|t|p63, a p53 homolog at 3q27-29, encodes multiple products with transactivating, death-inducing, and dominant-negative activities.
9774969|a|We describe the cloning of p63, a gene at chromosome 3q27-29 that bears strong homology to the tumor suppressor p53 and to the related gene, p73. p63 was detected in a variety of human and mouse tissues, including proliferating basal cells of epithelial layers in the epidermis, cervix, urothelium, and prostate. Unlike p53, the p63 gene encodes multiple isotypes with remarkably divergent abilities to transactivate p53 reporter genes and induce apoptosis. Importantly, the predominant p63 isotypes in many epithelial tissues lack an acidic N terminus corresponding to the transactivation domain of p53. We demonstrate that these truncated p63 variants can act as dominant-negative agents toward transactivation by p53 and p63, and we suggest the possibility of physiological interactions among members of the p53 family.

9782094|t|Coding sequence and expression patterns of mouse chordin and mapping of the cognate mouse chrd and human CHRD genes.
9782094|a|Chordin is a key developmental protein that dorsalizes early vertebrate embryonic tissues by binding to ventralizing TGF-beta-like bone morphogenetic proteins and sequestering them in latent complexes. Here we report the first characterization of mammalian chordin. The full-length cDNA sequence for mouse chordin is given, and RNA blot analysis shows the murine chordin gene Chrd to be expressed at relatively high levels in 7-day postcoitum mouse embryos and at much decreased levels at later developmental times and in adult tissues. These results imply a major role for chordin during gastrulation of the mammalian embryo. Nevertheless, both murine and human chordin genes are shown to be expressed at readily detectable levels in several fetal and adult tissues, most notably liver and cerebellum, suggesting additional roles in organogenesis and homeostasis. Chrd was mapped to mouse chromosome 16 using interspecific crosses, and the cognate human gene CHRD was localized to human chromosome 3q27 by radiation hybrid mapping.

9786908|t|Cloning and characterization of a novel human hepatocyte transcription factor, hB1F, which binds and activates enhancer II of hepatitis B virus.
9786908|a|Enhancer II (ENII) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the essential cis-elements for the transcriptional regulation of HBV gene expression. Its function is highly liver-specific, suggesting that liver-enriched transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating the activity of ENII. In this report, a novel hepatocyte transcription factor, which binds specifically to the B1 region (AACGACCGACCTTGAG) within the major functional unit (B unit) of ENII, has been cloned from a human liver cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid screening, and demonstrated to trans-activate ENII via the B1 region. We named this factor hB1F, for human B1-binding factor. Amino acid analysis revealed this factor structurally belongs to nuclear receptor superfamily. Based on the sequence similarities, hB1F is characterized to be a novel human homolog of the orphan receptor fushi tarazu factor I (FTZ-F1). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, a splicing isoform of hB1F (hB1F-2) was identified, which has an extra 46 amino acid residues in the A/B region. Examination of the tissue distribution has revealed an abundant 5.2-kilobase transcript of hB1F is present specifically in human pancreas and liver. Interestingly, an additional transcript of 3.8 kilobases was found to be present in hepatoma cells HepG2. Fluorescent in situ hybridization has mapped the gene locus of hB1F to the region q31-32.1 of human chromosome 1. Altogether, this study provides the first report that a novel human homolog of FTZ-F1 binds and regulates ENII of HBV. The potential roles of this FTZ-F1 homolog in tissue-specific gene regulation, in embryonic development, as well as in liver carcinogenesis are discussed.

9829980|t|Diva, a Bcl-2 homologue that binds directly to Apaf-1 and induces BH3-independent cell death.
9829980|a|We have identified and characterized Diva, which is a novel regulator of apoptosis. Sequence analysis revealed that Diva is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins containing Bcl-2 homology domain 1, 2, 3, and 4 (BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4) regions and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain. The expression of Diva mRNA was detected in multiple embryonic tissues but was restricted to the ovary and testis in adult mice. The expression of Diva promoted the death of 293T, Ramsey, and T47D cells as well as that of primary sensory neurons, indicating that Diva is a proapoptotic protein. Significantly, Diva lacks critical residues in the conserved BH3 region that mediate the interaction between BH3-containing proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues and their prosurvival binding partners. Consistent with this, Diva did not bind to cellular Bcl-2 family members including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1/Bfl-1. Furthermore, mutants of Diva lacking the BH3 region fully retained their proapoptotic activity, confirming that Diva promotes apoptosis in a BH3-independent manner. Significantly, Diva interacted with a viral Bcl-2 homologue (vBcl-2) encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Consistent with these associations, apoptosis induced by Diva was inhibited by vBcl-2 but not by Bcl-XL. Importantly, Diva interacted with Apaf-1, an adapter molecule that activates caspase-9, a central death protease of the apoptotic pathway. The expression of Diva inhibited the binding of Bcl-XL to Apaf-1, as determined by immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, Diva represents a novel type of proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue that promotes apoptosis independently of the BH3 region through direct binding to Apaf-1, thus preventing Bcl-XL from binding to the caspase-9 regulator Apaf-1.

9878755|t|Cloning and characterization of CRF, a novel C1q-related factor, expressed in areas of the brain involved in motor function.
9878755|a|We have isolated and characterized a novel cDNA, C1q-Related Factor (CRF), that is predicted to encode a 258 amino acid polypeptide with a hydrophobic signal sequence, a collagenous region, and a globular domain at the carboxy terminus that shares homology to the C1q signature domain. Human CRF transcript is expressed at highest levels in the brain, particularly in the brainstem. In situ hybridization to mouse brain sections demonstrated that CRF transcripts are most abundant in areas of the nervous system involved in motor function, such as the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the accessory olivary nucleus, the pons and the red nucleus. The mouse CRF homolog is highly similar to the human gene at both the nucleotide and protein level, suggesting an important conserved role for this protein.   Copyright 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

9932288|t|Cloning, gene structure and genomic localization of an orphan transporter from mouse kidney with six alternatively-spliced isoforms.
9932288|a|Two genes were identified and characterized that express cDNAs related to previously identified neurotransmitter and/or osmolyte transporters, but which are expressed specifically in the kidney. RNA transcribed from one of these two genes (XT2) was found to undergo an extensive degree of alternative splicing to generate six distinct isoforms. The intron-exon structure of the XT2 gene and the sites of alternative splicing were identified. Expression of the second gene (XT3) was found to be conserved in human kidney, and partial sequence was obtained from a human cDNA library. The expressions of both XT2 and XT3 RNAs were determined in mouse and human tissues, respectively, and the locations of the two genes within the mouse genome were identified. Screening experiments to identify the substrate(s) of these proteins failed to identify specific uptake with any of the tested compounds; however, immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that epitope-tagged variants of the protein products of the XT2 and XT3 cDNAs were present on the plasma membrane of transfected cells.

28628113|t|MicroRNA-20a-mediated loss of autophagy contributes to breast tumorigenesis by promoting genomic damage and instability.
28628113|a|Gene expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data set show that miR-20a is upregulated in human breast cancer, especially in triple-negative subtype. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggests that miR-20a expression negatively correlates with the autophagy/lysosome pathway. We report here that miR-20a inhibits the basal and nutrient starvation-induced autophagic flux and lysosomal proteolytic activity, increases intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and DNA damage response by targeting several key regulators of autophagy, including BECN1, ATG16L1 and SQSTM1. Re-introduction of exogenous BECN1, ATG16L1 or SQSTM1 reverses the inhibitory effect of miR-20a on autophagy and decreases DNA damage. A negative correlation between miR-20a and its target genes is observed in breast cancer tissues. Lower levels of BECN1, ATG16L1 and SQSTM1 are more common in triple-negative cancers than in other subtypes. High levels of miR-20a also associate with higher frequency of copy-number alterations and DNA mutations in breast cancer patients. Further studies in a xenograft mouse model show that miR-20a promotes tumor initiation and tumor growth. Collectively, these findings suggest that miR-20a-mediated autophagy defect might be a new mechanism underlying the oncogenic function of miRNA during breast tumorigenesis.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 June 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.193.

21731759|t|Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) is critical for leptin-induced proliferation, migration and VEGF/VEGFR-2 expression in breast cancer.
21731759|a|High levels of pro-angiogenic factors, leptin, IL-1, Notch and VEGF (ligands and receptors), are found in breast cancer, which is commonly correlated with metastasis and lower survival of patients. We have previously reported that leptin induces the growth of breast cancer and the expression of VEGF/VEGFR-2 and IL-1 system. We hypothesized that Notch, IL-1 and leptin crosstalk outcome (NILCO) plays an essential role in the regulation of leptin-mediated induction of proliferation/migration and expression of pro-angiogenic molecules in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, leptin's effects on the expression and activation of Notch signaling pathway and VEGF/VEGFR-2/IL-1 were determined in mouse (4T1, EMT6 and MMT) breast cancer cells. Remarkably, leptin up-regulated Notch1-4/JAG1/Dll-4, Notch target genes: Hey2 and survivin, together with IL-1 and VEGF/VEGFR-2. RNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibitors of leptin signaling significantly abrogated activity of reporter gene-luciferase CSL (RBP-Jk) promoter, showing that it was linked to leptin-activated JAK2/STAT3, MAPK, PI-3K/mTOR, p38 and JNK signaling pathways. Interestingly, leptin upregulatory effects on cell proliferation/migration and pro-angiogenic factors Notch, IL-1 and VEGF/VEGFR-2 were abrogated by a gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, as well as siRNA against CSL. In addition, blockade of IL-1R tI inhibited leptin-induced Notch, Hey2 and survivin as well as VEGF/VEGFR-2 expression. These data suggest leptin is an inducer of Notch (expression/activation) and IL-1 signaling modulates leptin effects on Notch and VEGF/VEGFR-2. We show for the first time that a novel unveiled crosstalk between Notch, IL-1 and leptin (NILCO) occurs in breast cancer. Leptin induction of proliferation/migration and upregulation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in breast cancer cells were related to an intact Notch signaling axis. NILCO could represent the integration of developmental, pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic signals critical for leptin-induced cell proliferation/migration and regulation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in breast cancer. Targeting NILCO might help to design new pharmacological strategies aimed at controlling breast cancer growth and angiogenesis.

19306381|t|Neuregulin-1 beta and neuregulin-1 alpha differentially affect the migration and invasion of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cells.
19306381|a|Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the most common malignancy associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). These Schwann cell lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue, frequently precluding surgical resection. Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior. We have shown that MPNSTs express neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during development, and NRG-1 alpha isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly understood. Hypothesizing that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on collagen type I or fibronectin. The NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin. NRG-1 beta stimulated human and murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor. Both baseline and NRG-1 beta-induced migration were erbB-dependent and required the action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases and ROCK-I/II. In contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST lines and inhibited the migration of others. While NRG-1 beta potently and persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases, NRG-1 alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics distinct from those evident in NRG-1 beta-stimulated cells. These findings suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1 alpha differentially modulate this process.

20507639|t|Arecoline induces HA22T/VGH hepatoma cells to undergo anoikis - involvement of STAT3 and RhoA activation.
20507639|a|BACKGROUND: Our previous study showed that, in basal cell carcinoma cells, arecoline reduces levels of the tumor cell survival factor interleukin-6 (IL-6), increases levels of tumor suppressor factor p53, and elicits cell cycle arrest, followed by apoptosis. In preliminarily studies, we observed that arecoline induces detachment of the human-derived hepatoma cell line HA22T/VGH from the extracellular matrix. In the present study, we explored the fate of the detached HA22T/VGH cells and investigated the underlying mechanism. METHODS: HA22T/VGH cells or primary cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with arecoline, then changes in morphology, viability, apoptosis, and the expression of surface beta1-integrin, apoptosis-related proteins, and IL-6 were examined. Furthermore, activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway and the RhoA/Rock signaling pathway, including p190RhoGAP and Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase SHP2, was examined. RESULTS: A low concentration of arecoline (   <or= 100 microg/ml) caused cytoskeletal changes in HA22T/VGH cells, but not hepatocytes, and this was accompanied by decreased beta1-integrin expression and followed by apoptosis, indicating that HA22T/VGH cells undergo anoikis after arecoline treatment. IL-6 expression and phosphorylation of STAT3, which provides protection against anoikis, were inhibited and levels of downstream signaling proteins, including Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, were decreased, while Bax expression, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activity were increased. In addition, phosphorylation/activation of p190RhoGAP, a RhoA inhibitor, and of its upstream regulator, SHP2, was inhibited by arecoline treatment, while Rho/Rock activation was increased. Addition of the RhoA inhibitor attenuated the effects of arecoline. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that arecoline induces anoikis of HA22T/VGH cells involving inhibition of STAT3 and increased RhoA/Rock activation and that the STAT3 and RhoA/Rock signaling pathways are connected.

27663860|t|Role of angiotensin II type 1a receptor in renal injury induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension.
27663860|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo role of angiotensin II type 1a (AT1a) receptor in renal damage as a result of hypertension by using transgenic mice with AT1a receptor gene disruption. Transgenic mice that express human liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) with or without disruption of the AT1a receptor gene (L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(-/-), and L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(+/+), respectively) were used with urinary L-FABP as an indicator of tubulointerstitial damage. Those female mice were administered subcutaneously deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt tablets plus drinking water that contained 1% saline for 28 d after uninephrectomy. In L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(+/+) mice that received DOCA-salt treatment, hypertension was induced and slight expansion of glomerular area, glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial damage were observed. In L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(-/-) mice that received DOCA-salt treatment, hypertension was similarly induced and the degree of glomerular damage was significantly more severe than in L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(+/+)-DOCA mice. Urinary L-FABP levels were significantly higher in L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(-/-)-DOCA mice compared with those in L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(+/+)-DOCA mice. Hydralazine treatment significantly attenuated renal damage that was found in L-FABP(+/-) AT1a(-/-)-DOCA mice along with a reduction in blood pressure. In summary, activation of the AT1a receptor may contribute to maintenance of the glomerular structure against hypertensive renal damage.-Hisamichi, M., Kamijo-Ikemori, A., Sugaya, T., Ichikawa, D., Natsuki, T., Hoshino, S., Kimura, K., Shibagaki, Y.

25211016|t|RBFOX1 cooperates with MBNL1 to control splicing in muscle, including events altered in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
25211016|a|With the goal of identifying splicing alterations in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) tissues that may yield insights into targets or mechanisms, we have surveyed mis-splicing events in three systems using a RT-PCR screening and validation platform. First, a transgenic mouse model expressing CUG-repeats identified splicing alterations shared with other mouse models of DM1. Second, using cell cultures from human embryonic muscle, we noted that DM1-associated splicing alterations were significantly enriched in cytoskeleton (e.g. SORBS1, TACC2, TTN, ACTN1 and DMD) and channel (e.g. KCND3 and TRPM4) genes. Third, of the splicing alterations occurring in adult DM1 tissues, one produced a dominant negative variant of the splicing regulator RBFOX1. Notably, half of the splicing events controlled by MBNL1 were co-regulated by RBFOX1, and several events in this category were mis-spliced in DM1 tissues. Our results suggest that reduced RBFOX1 activity in DM1 tissues may amplify several of the splicing alterations caused by the deficiency in MBNL1.

26655640|t|Dioscin alleviates alcoholic liver fibrosis by attenuating hepatic stellate cell activation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB signaling pathway.
26655640|a|The present work aimed to investigate the activities and underlying mechanisms of dioscin against alcoholic liver fibrosis (ALF). In vivo liver fibrosis in mice was induced by an alcoholic liquid diet, and in vitro studies were performed on activated HSC-T6 and LX2 cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. Our results showed that dioscin significantly attenuated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, improved collagen accumulation, and attenuated inflammation through down-regulating the levels of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-a by decreasing Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 expression both in vivo and in vitro. TLR4 overexpression was also decreased by dioscin, leading to the markedly down-regulated levels of MyD88, NF-kB, transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1), a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and type I collagen (COL1A1) in cultured HSCs. Suppression of cellular MyD88 by ST2825 or abrogation of NF-kB by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate eliminated the inhibitory effects of dioscin on the levels of TGF-b1, a-SMA and COL1A1. In a word, dioscin exhibited potent effects against ALF via altering TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB signaling pathway, which provided novel insights into the mechanisms of this compound as an antifibrogenic candidate for the treatment of ALF in the future.

19201842|t|Gammadelta T lymphocyte homeostasis is negatively regulated by beta2-microglobulin.
19201842|a|Successful application of gammadelta T cells in adoptive cell therapies depends upon our ability to maintain these cells in vivo. Using an adoptive transfer model to study lymphopenia-induced homeostatic expansion, we show that CD8(+) and NK1.1(+) gammadelta T cell subsets are differentially regulated. While CD8(+) gammadelta T cells have an early and sustained advantage following transfer into TCRbeta(-/-)/delta(-/-) mice, NK1.1(+) gammadelta T cells proliferate slowly and are maintained at low numbers. The advantage of the CD8(+) subset could not be explained by increased bcl-2 or cytokine receptor expression but did correlate with Vgamma4(+) and Vdelta5(+) expression. Despite the role of CD8 in MHC class I recognition by alphabeta T cells, beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-associated MHC class I molecules were not required for CD8(+) gammadelta T cell homeostatic expansion. Surprisingly, all gammadelta T cells, including the CD8(+) subset, exhibited enhanced proliferation following adoptive transfer into Rag1(-/-)/beta(2)m(-/-) compared with Rag1(-/-) recipients. This effect was most notable for the NK1.1(+) subset, which expresses high levels of NKG2A/CD94 and Ly49. Although expression of these inhibitory receptors correlated with poor homeostatic expansion in the presence of beta(2)m, gammadelta T cell homeostatic proliferation in TCRbeta(-/-)/delta(-/-) mice was not altered in the presence of Ly49C/I- and NKG2-blocking Abs. While the mechanism by which beta(2)m negatively regulates gammadelta T cell homeostasis remains to be determined, this observation is unique to gammadelta T cells and confirms that multiple mechanisms are in place to maintain strict regulation of both the size and the composition of the gammadelta T cell pool.

28294943|t|A team of heterochromatin factors collaborates with small RNA pathways to combat repetitive elements and germline stress.
28294943|a|Repetitive sequences derived from transposons make up a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes and must be silenced to protect genome integrity. Repetitive elements are often found in heterochromatin; however, the roles and interactions of heterochromatin proteins in repeat regulation are poorly understood. Here we show that a diverse set of C. elegans heterochromatin proteins act together with the piRNA and nuclear RNAi pathways to silence repetitive elements and prevent genotoxic stress in the germ line. Mutants in genes encoding HPL-2/HP1, LIN-13, LIN-61, LET-418/Mi-2, and H3K9me2 histone methyltransferase MET-2/SETDB1 also show functionally redundant sterility, increased germline apoptosis, DNA repair defects, and interactions with small RNA pathways. Remarkably, fertility of heterochromatin mutants could be partially restored by inhibiting cep-1/p53, endogenous meiotic double strand breaks, or the expression of MIRAGE1 DNA transposons. Functional redundancy among factors and pathways underlies the importance of safeguarding the genome through multiple means.

30107177|t|Cooperative Enhancer Activation by TLX1 and STAT5 Drives Development of NUP214-ABL1/TLX1-Positive T Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
30107177|a|The NUP214-ABL1 fusion is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is significantly associated with overexpression of the TLX1 and TLX3 transcription factors in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we show that NUP214-ABL1 cooperates with TLX1 in driving T-ALL development using a transgenic mouse model and human T-ALL cells. Using integrated ChIP-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and RNA-sequencing data, we demonstrate that TLX1 and STAT5, the downstream effector of NUP214-ABL1, co-bind poised enhancer regions, and cooperatively activate the expression of key proto-oncogenes such as MYC and BCL2. Inhibition of STAT5, downregulation of TLX1 or MYC, or interference with enhancer function through BET-inhibitor treatment leads to reduction of target gene expression and induction of leukemia cell death.

28273463|t|Reversal of DDK-Mediated MCM Phosphorylation by Rif1-PP1 Regulates Replication Initiation and Replisome Stability Independently of ATR/Chk1.
28273463|a|Dbf4-dependent kinases (DDKs) are required for the initiation of DNA replication, their essential targets being the MCM2-7 proteins. We show that, in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and human cells, hyper-phosphorylation of DNA-bound Mcm4, but not phosphorylation of Mcm2, correlates with DNA replication. These phosphorylations are differentially affected by the DDK inhibitors PHA-767491 and XL413. We show that DDK-dependent MCM phosphorylation is reversed by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) targeted to chromatin by Rif1. Loss of Rif1 increased MCM phosphorylation and the rate of replication initiation and also compromised the ability of cells to block initiation when challenged with replication inhibitors. We also provide evidence that Rif1 can mediate MCM dephosphorylation at replication forks and that the stability of dephosphorylated replisomes strongly depends on Chk1 activity. We propose that both replication initiation and replisome stability depend on MCM phosphorylation, which is maintained by a balance of DDK-dependent phosphorylation and Rif1-mediated dephosphorylation.

27099072|t|Human wild-type full-length tau accumulation disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and the functions via increasing mitofusins.
27099072|a|Intracellular accumulation of tau protein is hallmark of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the cellular mechanism whereby tau accumulation causes neurodegeneration is poorly understood. Here we report that overexpression of human wild-type full-length tau (termed htau) disrupted mitochondrial dynamics by enhancing fusion and induced their perinuclear accumulation in HEK293 cells and rat primary hippocampal neurons. The htau accumulation at later stage inhibited mitochondrial functions shown by the decreased ATP level, the ratio of ATP/ADP and complex I activity. Simultaneously, the cell viability was decreased with retraction of the cellular/neuronal processes. Further studies demonstrated that htau accumulation increased fusion proteins, including OPA1 and mitofusins (Mfn1, Mfn2) and reduced the ubiquitination of Mfn2. Downregulation of the mitofusins by shRNA to ~45% or ~52% of the control levels attenuated the htau-enhanced mitochondrial fusion and restored the functions, while downregulation of OPA1 to ~50% of the control level did not show rescue effects. Finally, abnormal mitochondrial accumulation and dysfunction were also observed in the brains of htau transgenic mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate that htau accumulation decreases cell viability and causes degeneration via enhancing mitofusin-associated mitochondrial fusion, which provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathies.

21931565|t|Release of Ku and MRN from DNA ends by Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1 is required for homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks.
21931565|a|The multifunctional Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) protein complex recruits ATM/Tel1 checkpoint kinase and CtIP/Ctp1 homologous recombination (HR) repair factor to double-strand breaks (DSBs). HR repair commences with the 5'-to-3' resection of DNA ends, generating 3' single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhangs that bind Replication Protein A (RPA) complex, followed by Rad51 recombinase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex is critical for DSB resection, although the enigmatic ssDNA endonuclease activity of Mre11 and the DNA-end processing factor Sae2 (CtIP/Ctp1 ortholog) are largely unnecessary unless the resection activities of Exo1 and Sgs1-Dna2 are also eliminated. Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1/CtIP are essential for DSB repair in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammals. To investigate DNA end resection in Schizo. pombe, we adapted an assay that directly measures ssDNA formation at a defined DSB. We found that Mre11 and Ctp1 are essential for the efficient initiation of resection, consistent with their equally crucial roles in DSB repair. Exo1 is largely responsible for extended resection up to 3.1 kb from a DSB, with an activity dependent on Rqh1 (Sgs1) DNA helicase having a minor role. Despite its critical function in DSB repair, Mre11 nuclease activity is not required for resection in fission yeast. However, Mre11 nuclease and Ctp1 are required to disassociate the MRN complex and the Ku70-Ku80 nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) complex from DSBs, which is required for efficient RPA localization. Eliminating Ku makes Mre11 nuclease activity dispensable for MRN disassociation and RPA localization, while improving repair of a one-ended DSB formed by replication fork collapse. From these data we propose that release of the MRN complex and Ku from DNA ends by Mre11 nuclease activity and Ctp1 is a critical step required to expose ssDNA for RPA localization and ensuing HR repair.

20926645|t|Severe polyposis in Apc(1322T) mice is associated with submaximal Wnt signalling and increased expression of the stem cell marker Lgr5.
20926645|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a tumour suppressor gene mutated in the germline of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and somatically in most colorectal cancers. APC mutations impair b-catenin degradation, resulting in increased Wnt signalling. The most frequent APC mutation is a codon 1309 truncation that is associated with severe FAP. A previous study compared two mouse models of intestinal tumorigenesis, Apc(R850X) (Min) and Apc(1322T) (1322T), the latter a model of human codon 1309 changes. 1322T mice had more severe polyposis but, surprisingly, these tumours had lower levels of nuclear b-catenin than Min tumours. The consequences of these different b-catenin levels were investigated. METHODS: Enterocytes were isolated from 1322T and Min tumours by microdissection and gene expression profiling was performed. Differentially expressed Wnt targets and other stem cell markers were validated using quantitative PCR, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: As expected, lower nuclear b-catenin levels in 1322T lesions were associated with generally lower levels of Wnt target expression. However, expression of the Wnt target and stem cell marker Lgr5 was significantly higher in 1322T tumours than in Min tumours. Other stem cell markers (Musashi1, Bmi1 and the Wnt target Cd44) were also at higher levels in 1322T tumours. In addition, expression of the Bmp antagonist Gremlin1 was higher in 1322T tumours, together with lower Bmp2 and Bmp4 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The severe phenotype caused by truncation of Apc at codon 1322 is associated with an increased number of stem cells. Thus, a submaximal level of Wnt signalling favours the stem cell phenotype and this may promote tumorigenesis. A level of Wnt signalling exists that is too high for optimal tumour growth.

26971998|t|The Innate Immune Receptor NLRX1 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Reducing Colon Tumorigenesis and Key Tumor-Promoting Signals.
26971998|a|NOD-like receptor (NLR) proteins are intracellular innate immune sensors/receptors that regulate immunity. This work shows that NLRX1 serves as a tumor suppressor in colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and sporadic colon cancer by keeping key tumor promoting pathways in check. Nlrx1(-/-) mice were highly susceptible to CAC, showing increases in key cancer-promoting pathways including nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The tumor-suppressive function of NLRX1 originated primarily from the non-hematopoietic compartment. This prompted an analysis of NLRX1 function in the Apc(min/+) genetic model of sporadic gastrointestinal cancer. NLRX1 attenuated Apc(min/+) colon tumorigenesis, cellular proliferation, NF-kB, MAPK, STAT3 activation, and IL-6 levels. Application of anti-interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) antibody therapy reduced tumor burden, increased survival, and reduced STAT3 activation in Nlrx1(-/-)Apc(min/+) mice. As an important clinical correlate, human colon cancer samples expressed lower levels of NLRX1 than healthy controls in multiple patient cohorts. These data implicate anti-IL6R as a potential personalized therapy for colon cancers with reduced NLRX1.

26476672|t|Wnt signaling in age-related macular degeneration: human macular tissue and mouse model.
26476672|a|BACKGROUND: The wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling is a group of signal transduction pathways. In canonical Wnt pathway, Wnt ligands bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5 or LRP6), resulting in phosphorylation and activation of the receptor. We hypothesize that canonical Wnt pathway plays a role in the retinal lesion of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of irreversible central visual loss in elderly. METHODS: We examined LRP6 phosphorylation and Wnt signaling cascade in human retinal sections and plasma kallistatin, an endogenous inhibitor of the Wnt pathway in AMD patients and non-AMD subjects. We also used the Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 and Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (gfp/gfp) mouse models with AMD-like retinal degeneration to further explore the involvement of Wnt signaling activation in the retinal lesions in those models and to preclinically evaluate the role of Wnt signaling suppression as a potential therapeutic option for AMD. RESULTS: We found higher levels of LRP6 (a key Wnt signaling receptor) protein phosphorylation and transcripts of the Wnt pathway-targeted genes, as well as higher beta-catenin protein in AMD macula compared to controls. Kallistatin was decreased in the plasma of AMD patients. Retinal non-phosphorylated-b-catenin and phosphorylated-LRP6 were higher in Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 mice than that in wild type. Intravitreal administration of an anti-LRP6 antibody slowed the progression of retinal lesions in Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 and Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (gfp/gfp) mice. Electroretinography of treated eyes exhibited larger amplitudes compared to controls in both mouse models. A2E, a retinoid byproduct associated with AMD was lower in the treated eyes of Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 mice. Anti-LRP6 also suppressed the expression of Tnf-a and Icam-1 in Ccl2 (-/-) /Cx3cr1 (-/-) /rd8 retinas. CONCLUSIONS: Wnt signaling may be disturbed in AMD patients, which could contribute to the retinal inflammation and increased A2E levels found in AMD. Aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling might also contribute to the focal retinal degenerative lesions of mouse models with Ccl2 and Cx3cr1 deficiency, and intravitreal administration of anti-LRP6 antibody could be beneficial by deactivating the canonical Wnt pathway.

27470968|t|PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade Enhances T-cell Activity and Antitumor Efficacy of Imatinib in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.
27470968|a|PURPOSE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) but often are of transient benefit as resistance commonly develops. Immunotherapy, particularly blockade of the inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) or the ligand programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), has shown effectiveness in a variety of cancers. The functional effects of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade are unknown in GISTs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed tumor and matched blood samples from 85 patients with GISTs and determined the expression of immune checkpoint molecules using flow cytometry. We investigated the combination of imatinib with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in KitV558Delta/+ mice that develop GISTs. RESULTS: The inhibitory receptors PD-1, lymphocyte activation gene 3, and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 were upregulated on tumor-infiltrating T cells compared with T cells from matched blood. PD-1 expression on T cells was highest in imatinib-treated human GISTs. Meanwhile, intratumoral PD-L1 expression was variable. In human GIST cell lines, treatment with imatinib abrogated the IFNgamma-induced upregulation of PD-L1 via STAT1 inhibition. In KitV558Delta/+ mice, imatinib downregulated IFNgamma-related genes and reduced PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade in vivo each had no efficacy alone but enhanced the antitumor effects of imatinib by increasing T-cell effector function in the presence of KIT and IDO inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is a promising strategy to improve the effects of targeted therapy in GISTs. Collectively, our results provide the rationale to combine these agents in human GISTs.

25826077|t|FLT3-ITD confers resistance to the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors by protecting the mTOR/4EBP1/Mcl-1 pathway through STAT5 activation in acute myeloid leukemia.
25826077|a|FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are the most frequent tyrosine kinase mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the former associated with poor prognosis. Here, we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 induced apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway more efficiently in hematopoietic 32D cells driven by FLT3-TKD (32D/TKD) than FLT3-ITD (32D/ITD), which robustly activated STAT5. The resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 was gained by expression of the constitutively activated STAT5 mutant STAT5A1*6 in 32D/TKD cells, while it was abrogated by the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide in 32D/ITD cells or FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemic MV4-11 cells. GDC-0941 or MK-2206 induced dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 more conspicuously in 32D/TKD than in 32D/ITD, which was prevented or augmented by STAT5A1*6 or pimozide, respectively, and correlated with downregulation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex formation and Mcl-1 expression. Furthermore, exogenous expression of Mcl-1 endowed resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 on 32D/TKD cells. Finally, it was confirmed in primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD that pimozide enhanced 4EBP1 dephosphorylation and Mcl-1 downregulation to augment cytotoxicity of GDC-0941. These data suggest that the robust STAT5 activation by FLT3-ITD protects cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors from apoptosis by maintaining Mcl-1 expression through the mTORC1/4EBP1/eIF4E pathway.

21637860|t|Oxidized LDL receptor 1 (OLR1) as a possible link between obesity, dyslipidemia and cancer.
21637860|a|Recent studies have linked expression of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor 1 (OLR1) to tumorigenesis. We analyzed microarray data from Olr1 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice for genes involved in cellular transformation and evaluated effects of OLR1 over-expression in normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) and breast cancer cells (HCC1143) in terms of gene expression, migration, adhesion and transendothelial migration. Twenty-six out of 238 genes were inhibited in tissues of OLR1 KO mice; the vast majority of OLR1 sensitive genes contained NF-kB binding sites in their promoters. Further studies revealed broad inhibition of NF-kB target genes outside of the transformation-associated gene pool, with enrichment themes of defense response, immune response, apoptosis, proliferation, and wound healing. Transcriptome of Olr1 KO mice also revealed inhibition of de novo lipogenesis, rate-limiting enzymes fatty acid synthase (Fasn), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd1) and ELOVL family member 6 (Elovl6), as well as lipolytic phospholipase A2 group IVB (Pla2g4b). In studies comparing MCF10A and HCC1143, the latter displayed 60% higher OLR1 expression. Forced over-expression of OLR1 resulted in upregulation of NF-kB (p65) and its target pro-oncogenes involved in inhibition of apoptosis (BCL2, BCL2A1, TNFAIP3) and regulation of cell cycle (CCND2) in both cell lines. Basal expression of FASN, SCD1 and PLA2G4B, as well as lipogenesis transcription factors PPARA, SREBF2 and CREM, was higher in HCC1143 cells. Over-expression of OLR1 in HCC1143 cells also enhanced cell migration, without affecting their adherence to TNFa-activated endothelium or transendothelial migration. On the other hand, OLR1 neutralizing antibody inhibited both adhesion and transmigration of untreated HCC1143 cells. We conclude that OLR1 may act as an oncogene by activation of NF-kB target genes responsible for proliferation, migration and inhibition of apoptosis and de novo lipogenesis genes.

28406477|t|miR-21 ablation and obeticholic acid ameliorate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.
28406477|a|microRNAs were recently suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease lacking specific pharmacological treatments. In that regard, nuclear receptors are arising as key molecular targets for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Here we show that, in a typical model of NASH-associated liver damage, microRNA-21 (miR-21) ablation results in a progressive decrease in steatosis, inflammation and lipoapoptosis, with impairment of fibrosis. In a complementary fast food (FF) diet NASH model, mimicking features of the metabolic syndrome, miR-21 levels increase in both liver and muscle, concomitantly with decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa), a key miR-21 target. Strikingly, miR-21 knockout mice fed the FF diet supplemented with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) display minimal steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and cholesterol accumulation. In addition, lipoprotein metabolism was restored, including decreased fatty acid uptake and polyunsaturation, and liver and muscle insulin sensitivity fully reinstated. Finally, the miR-21/PPARa axis was found amplified in liver and muscle biopsies, and in serum, of NAFLD patients, co-substantiating its role in the development of the metabolic syndrome. By unveiling that miR-21 abrogation, together with FXR activation by OCA, significantly improves whole body metabolic parameters in NASH, our results highlight the therapeutic potential of nuclear receptor multi-targeting therapies for NAFLD.

24586582|t|Miz1 deficiency in the mammary gland causes a lactation defect by attenuated Stat5 expression and phosphorylation.
24586582|a|Miz1 is a zinc finger transcription factor with an N-terminal POZ domain. Complexes with Myc, Bcl-6 or Gfi-1 repress expression of genes like Cdkn2b (p15(Ink4)) or Cdkn1a (p21(Cip1)). The role of Miz1 in normal mammary gland development has not been addressed so far. Conditional knockout of the Miz1 POZ domain in luminal cells during pregnancy caused a lactation defect with a transient reduction of glandular tissue, reduced proliferation and attenuated differentiation. This was recapitulated in vitro using mouse mammary gland derived HC11 cells. Further analysis revealed decreased Stat5 activity in Miz1DPOZ mammary glands and an attenuated expression of Stat5 targets. Gene expression of the Prolactin receptor (PrlR) and ErbB4, both critical for Stat5 phosphorylation (pStat5) or pStat5 nuclear translocation, was decreased in Miz1DPOZ females. Microarray, ChIP-Seq and gene set enrichment analysis revealed a down-regulation of Miz1 target genes being involved in vesicular transport processes. Our data suggest that deranged intracellular transport and localization of PrlR and ErbB4 disrupt the Stat5 signalling pathway in mutant glands and cause the observed lactation phenotype.

18949367|t|Over-expression of ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase-L1 induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
18949367|a|Ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) belongs to the UCH proteases family that deubiquitinates ubiquitin-protein conjugates in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Previous research showed that UCH-L1 was expressed in mouse retinal cells and testicular germ cells, and its function was associated with apoptosis. But it is still unclear whether UCH-L1 is concerned with apoptosis in tumor cells. In order to clarify the role of UCH-L1 in tumor cells, multi-drug resistance (MDR) human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7/Adr, that expresses relatively high UCH-L1, and its parental cell line MCF7, that expresses relatively low UCH-L1, were chosen for this study. We transfected pcDNA3.1-UCH-L1 plasmid and UCH-L1 siRNA into MCF7 and MCF7/Adr cells, respectively. Using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, western blot, Hoechst 33258 staining assay and flow cytometry, we found that over-expression of UCH-L1 in MCF7 cells induced apoptosis. On the other hand, silencing of UCH-L1 in MCF7/Adr cells led to the opposite effect. Moreover, to explore the mechanism underling these observations, we further investigated the expression of phospho-Akt and its downstream signal phospho-IkB-alpha and other signal molecules including Fas, Fas-L, Trail, DR4, DR5, Bax, cytochrome C, active caspase-3, phospho-p53, phospho-Mdm-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, p21 and p27. The results indicated that the process of apoptosis triggered by UCH-L1 is, at least in part, probably through Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal pathway. Our findings suggest that modulating the ubiquitination and deubiquitination pathway could be a novel method for tumor therapy.

25885470|t|Identification of a unique hepatocellular carcinoma line, Li-7, with CD13(+) cancer stem cells hierarchy and population change upon its differentiation during culture and effects of sorafenib.
25885470|a|BACKGROUNDS: Cancer stem cell (CSC) research has highlighted the necessity of developing drugs targeting CSCs. We investigated a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line that not only has CSC hierarchy but also shows phenotypic changes (population changes) upon differentiation of CSC during culture and can be used for screening drugs targeting CSC. METHODS: Based on a hypothesis that the CSC proportion should decrease upon its differentiation into progenitors (population change), we tested HCC cell lines (HuH-7, Li-7, PLC/PRF/5, HLF, HLE) before and after 2 months culture for several markers (CD13, EpCAM, CD133, CD44, CD90, CD24, CD166). Tumorigenicity was tested using nude mice. To evaluate the CSC hierarchy, we investigated reconstructivity, proliferation, ALDH activity, spheroid formation, chemosensitivity and microarray analysis of the cell populations sorted by FACS. RESULTS: Only Li-7 cells showed a population change during culture: the proportion of CD13 positive cells decreased, while that of CD166 positive cells increased. The high tumorigenicity of the Li-7 was lost after the population change. CD13(+)/CD166(-) cells showed slow growth and reconstructed the bulk Li-7 populations composed of CD13(+)/CD166(-), CD13(-)/CD166(-) and CD13(-)/CD166(+) fractions, whereas CD13(-)/CD166(+) cells showed rapid growth but could not reproduce any other population. CD13(+)/CD166(-) cells showed high ALDH activity, spheroid forming ability and resistance to 5-fluorouracil. Microarray analysis demonstrated higher expression of stemness-related genes in CD166(-) than CD166(+) fraction. These results indicated a hierarchy in Li-7 cells, in which CD13(+)/CD166(-) and CD13(-)/CD166(+) cells serve as slow growing CSCs and rapid growing progenitors, respectively. Sorafenib selectively targeted the CD166(-) fraction, including CD13(+) CSCs, which exhibited higher mRNA expression for FGF3 and FGF4, candidate biomarkers for sorafenib. 5-fluorouracil followed by sorafenib inhibited the growth of bulk Li-7 cells more effectively than the reverse sequence or either alone. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a unique HCC line, Li-7, which not only shows heterogeneity for a CD13(+) CSC hierarchy, but also undergoes a "population change" upon CSC differentiation. Sorafenib targeted the CSC in vitro, supporting the use of this model for screening drugs targeting the CSC. This type of "heterogeneous, unstable" cell line may prove more useful in the CSC era than conventional "homogeneous, stable" cell lines.

25710042|t|Sex-differences in renal expression of selected transporters and transcription factors in lean and obese Zucker spontaneously hypertensive fatty rats.
25710042|a|The aim of this study was to identify sex-dependent expression of renal transporter mRNA in lean and obese Zucker spontaneously hypertensive fatty (ZSF1) rats and to investigate the interaction of the most altered transporter, organic anion transporter 2 (Oat2), with diabetes-relevant metabolites and drugs. Higher incidence of glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and protein casts in Bowman's space and tubular lumen was detected by PAS staining in obese male compared to female ZSF1 rats. Real-time PCR on RNA isolated from kidney cortex revealed that Sglt1-2, Oat1-3, and Oct1 were higher expressed in kidneys of lean females. Oct2 and Mrp2 were higher expressed in obese males. Renal mRNA levels of transporters were reduced with diabetic nephropathy in females and the expression of transcription factors Hnf1beta and Hnf4alpha in both sexes. The highest difference between lean and obese ZSF1 rats was found for Oat2. Therefore, we have tested the interaction of human OAT2 with various substances using tritium-labeled cGMP. Human OAT2 showed no interaction with diabetes-related metabolites, diabetic drugs, and ACE-inhibitors. However, OAT2-dependent uptake of cGMP was inhibited by furosemide. The strongly decreased expression of Oat2 and other transporters in female diabetic ZSF1 rats could possibly impair renal drug excretion, for example, of furosemide.

20226780|t|Zebrafish chordin-like and chordin are functionally redundant in regulating patterning of the dorsoventral axis.
20226780|a|Chordin is the prototype of a group of cysteine-rich domain-containing proteins that bind and modulate signaling of various TGFbeta-like ligands. Chordin-like 1 and 2 (CHL1 and 2) are two members of this group that have been described in human, mouse, and chick. However, in vivo roles for CHL1 and 2 in early development are unknown due to lack of loss-of-function analysis. Here we identify and characterize zebrafish, Danio rerio, CHL (Chl). The chl gene is on a region of chromosome 21 syntenic with the area of murine chromosome 7 bearing the CHL2 gene. Inability to identify a separate zebrafish gene corresponding to the mammalian CHL1 gene suggests that Chl may serve roles in zebrafish distributed between CHL1 and CHL2 in other species. Chl is a maternal factor that is also zygotically expressed later in development and has spatiotemporal expression patterns that differ from but overlap those of zebrafish chordin (Chd), suggesting differences but also possible overlap in developmental roles of the two proteins. Chl, like Chd, dorsalizes embryos upon overexpression and is cleaved by BMP1, which antagonizes this activity. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that Chl serves as a BMP antagonist with functions that overlap and are redundant with those of Chd in forming the dorsoventral axis.

25639242|t|Nitrogen regulates AMPK to control TORC1 signaling.
25639242|a|BACKGROUND: Cell growth and cell-cycle progression are tightly coordinated to enable cells to adjust their size (timing of division) to the demands of proliferation in varying nutritional environments. In fission yeast, nitrogen stress results in sustained proliferation at a reduced size. RESULTS: Here, we show that cells can sense nitrogen stress to reduce target of rapamycin complex-1 (TORC1) activity. Nitrogen-stress-induced TORC1 inhibition differs from amino-acid-dependent control of TORC1 and requires the Ssp2 (AMPKalpha) kinase, the Tsc1/2 complex, and Rhb1 GTPase. Importantly, the beta and gamma regulatory subunits of AMPK are not required to control cell division in response to nitrogen stress, providing evidence for a nitrogen-sensing mechanism that is independent of changes in intracellular ATP/AMP levels. The CaMKK homolog Ssp1 is constitutively required for phosphorylation of the AMPKalpha(Ssp2) T loop. However, we find that a second homolog CaMKK(Ppk34) is specifically required to stimulate AMPKalpha(Ssp2) activation in response to nitrogen stress. Finally, ammonia also controls mTORC1 activity in human cells; mTORC1 is activated upon the addition of ammonium to glutamine-starved Hep3B cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: The alternative nitrogen source ammonia can simulate TORC1 activity to support growth and division under challenging nutrient settings, a situation often seen in cancer.

24223959|t|Protective roles of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) in dengue virus infection of human lung epithelial cells.
24223959|a|Interferons (IFNs) are critical cytokines that regulate immune response against virus infections. Dengue virus (DV) infections are a major public health concern worldwide, and especially in Asia. In the present study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of action of IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) in human lung epithelial cells. The results demonstrated that DV infection induced expression of several IFITs, including IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5 in A549 cells. Induction of IFIT3 by DV infection was also observed in human dendritic cells. In a knockdown study, we showed that a signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2), but not STAT1 or STAT3, regulated DV-induced IFIT3 production. By using several different methods to evaluate cell death, we demonstrated that knockdown of IFIT3 led to cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of IFIT3 induced the expression of several apoptotic regulators such as caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). Such apoptotic effects and mechanisms were synergistically enhanced after DV infection. Moreover, under conditions of IFIT3 deficiency, viral production increased, suggesting an anti-viral effect of IFIT3. Interestingly, DV could suppress IFN-a-induced but not IFN-g-induced IFIT3 expression, a phenomenon similar to the regulation of STATs by DV. In conclusion, this study revealed some mechanisms of IFIT3 induction, and also demonstrated the protective roles of IFIT3 following IFN-a production in DV infection of human lung epithelial cells.

30442153|t|Ca2+-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress correlation with astrogliosis involves upregulation of KCa3.1 and inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling.
30442153|a|BACKGROUND: The intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa3.1 was recently shown to control the phenotype switch of reactive astrogliosis (RA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: KCa3.1 channels expression and cell localization in the brains of AD patients and APP/PS1 mice model were measured by immunoblotting and immunostaining. APP/PS1 mice and KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice were subjected to Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory deficits. Glia activation and neuron loss was measured by immunostaining. Fluo-4AM was used to measure cytosolic Ca2+ level in beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced reactive astrocytes in vitro. RESULTS: KCa3.1 expression was markedly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in both Abeta-stimulated primary astrocytes and brain lysates of AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice. The KCa3.1 channel was shown to regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through an interaction with the Ca2+ channel Orai1 in primary astrocytes. Gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 protected against SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and ER stress via the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in astrocytes. Importantly, gene deletion or blockade of KCa3.1 restored AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling both in vivo and in vitro. Consistent with these in vitro data, expression levels of the ER stress markers 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, as well as that of the RA marker glial fibrillary acidic protein were increased in APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Elimination of KCa3.1 in KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice corrected these abnormal responses. Moreover, glial activation and neuroinflammation were attenuated in the hippocampi of KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice, as compared with APP/PS1 mice. In addition, memory deficits and neuronal loss in APP/PS1 mice were reversed in KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that KCa3.1 is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in astrocytes and attenuation of the UPR and ER stress, thus contributing to memory deficits and neuronal loss.

19023445|t|A point mutation in translation initiation factor 2B leads to a continuous hyper stress state in oligodendroglial-derived cells.
19023445|a|BACKGROUND: Mutations in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) cause Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination (CACH), also known as Vanishing White Matter disease (VWM). The disease is manifested by loss of brain myelin upon physiological stress. In a previous study, we showed that fibroblasts isolated from CACH/VWM patients are hypersensitive to pharmacologically-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Since brain cells from affected individuals are not available for research, we wished to assess the effect of eIF2B mutation on oligodendroglial-derived cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A rat oligodendroglial-derived cell line was used for a stable knock-down of eIF2B5 followed by stable expression of mutated eIF2B5(R195H) cDNA. In response to a pharmacological ER-stress agent, eIF2B5(R195H) expressing cells exhibited heightened ER-stress response demonstrated by hyper induction of ATF4, GADD34, Bip, PDIA1, PDIA3, PDIA4 and PDIA6 proteins. Moreover, even in the absence of a pharmacological stress agent, eIF2B5(R195H)-expressing cells exhibited high basal levels of ATF4, GADD34 and ER-associated Bip, PDIA1 and PDIA3. SIGNIFICANCE: The data provide evidence that oligodendroglial-derived cells expressing a mutated eIF2B constantly use their stress response mechanism as an adaptation mean in order to survive. The current study is the first to demonstrate the effects of eIF2B5 mutation on ER homeostasis in oligodendroglial-derived cells.

29049388|t|An inducible mouse model of podocin-mutation-related nephrotic syndrome.
29049388|a|Mutations in the NPHS2 gene, encoding podocin, cause hereditary nephrotic syndrome. The most common podocin mutation, R138Q, is associated with early disease onset and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. Knock-in mice carrying a R140Q mutation, the mouse analogue of human R138Q, show developmental arrest of podocytes and lethal renal failure at neonatal age. Here we created a conditional podocin knock-in model named NPHS2 R140Q/-, using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase, which permits to study the effects of the mutation in postnatal life. Within the first week of R140Q hemizygosity induction the animals developed proteinuria, which peaked after 4-5 weeks. Subsequently the animals developed progressive renal failure, with a median survival time of 12 (95% CI: 11-13) weeks. Foot process fusion was observed within one week, progressing to severe and global effacement in the course of the disease. The number of podocytes per glomerulus gradually diminished to 18% compared to healthy controls 12-16 weeks after induction. The fraction of segmentally sclerosed glomeruli was 25%, 85% and 97% at 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis was present at later disease stage and was correlated quantitatively with the level of proteinuria at early disease stages. While R140Q podocin mRNA expression was elevated, protein abundance was reduced by more than 50% within one week following induction. Whereas miRNA21 expression persistently increased during the first 4 weeks, miRNA-193a expression peaked 2 weeks after induction. In conclusion, the inducible R140Q-podocin mouse model is an auspicious model of the most common genetic cause of human nephrotic syndrome, with a spontaneous disease course strongly reminiscent of the human disorder. This model constitutes a valuable tool to test the efficacy of novel pharmacological interventions aimed to improve podocyte function and viability and attenuate proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal failure.

30730884|t|The Drosophila fussel gene is required for bitter gustatory neuron differentiation acting within an Rpd3 dependent chromatin modifying complex.
30730884|a|Members of the Ski/Sno protein family are classified as proto-oncogenes and act as negative regulators of the TGF-ss/BMP-pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates. A newly identified member of this protein family is fussel (fuss), the Drosophila homologue of the human functional Smad suppressing elements (fussel-15 and fussel-18). We and others have shown that Fuss interacts with SMAD4 and that overexpression leads to a strong inhibition of Dpp signaling. However, to be able to characterize the endogenous Fuss function in Drosophila melanogaster, we have generated a number of state of the art tools including anti-Fuss antibodies, specific fuss-Gal4 lines and fuss mutant fly lines via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Fuss is a predominantly nuclear, postmitotic protein, mainly expressed in interneurons and fuss mutants are fully viable without any obvious developmental phenotype. To identify potential target genes or cells affected in fuss mutants, we conducted targeted DamID experiments in adult flies, which revealed the function of fuss in bitter gustatory neurons. We fully characterized fuss expression in the adult proboscis and by using food choice assays we were able to show that fuss mutants display defects in detecting bitter compounds. This correlated with a reduction of gustatory receptor gene expression (Gr33a, Gr66a, Gr93a) providing a molecular link to the behavioral phenotype. In addition, Fuss interacts with Rpd3, and downregulation of rpd3 in gustatory neurons phenocopies the loss of Fuss expression. Surprisingly, there is no colocalization of Fuss with phosphorylated Mad in the larval central nervous system, excluding a direct involvement of Fuss in Dpp/BMP signaling. Here we provide a first and exciting link of Fuss function in gustatory bitter neurons. Although gustatory receptors have been well characterized, little is known regarding the differentiation and maturation of gustatory neurons. This work therefore reveals Fuss as a pivotal element for the proper differentiation of bitter gustatory neurons acting within a chromatin modifying complex.

27930654|t|Whole-Organism Developmental Expression Profiling Identifies RAB-28 as a Novel Ciliary GTPase Associated with the BBSome and Intraflagellar Transport.
27930654|a|Primary cilia are specialised sensory and developmental signalling devices extending from the surface of most eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161 (FAM161A orthologue), CCDC-104 (CCDC104), and RPI-1 (RP1/RP1L1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab-28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL4/IFT27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.

29222418|t|HEB is required for the specification of fetal IL-17-producing gd T cells.
29222418|a|IL-17-producing gd T (gdT17) cells are critical components of the innate immune system. However, the gene networks that control their development are unclear. Here we show that HEB (HeLa E-box binding protein, encoded by Tcf12) is required for the generation of a newly defined subset of fetal-derived CD73- gdT17 cells. HEB is required in immature CD24+CD73- gd T cells for the expression of Sox4, Sox13, and Rorc, and these genes are repressed by acute expression of the HEB antagonist Id3. HEB-deficiency also affects mature CD73+ gd T cells, which are defective in RORgt expression and IL-17 production. Additionally, the fetal TCRg chain repertoire is altered, and peripheral Vg4 gd T cells are mostly restricted to the IFNg-producing phenotype in HEB-deficient mice. Therefore, our work identifies HEB-dependent pathways for the development of CD73+ and CD73- gdT17 cells, and provides mechanistic evidence for control of the gdT17 gene network by HEB.

28260042|t|Protective effect of naringin against the LPS-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells: Implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
28260042|a|Several studies have demonstrated that increased apoptosis plays an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders. It has been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces apoptosis largely through the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory mediators. In this study, we investigated the potential protective mechanisms of naringin (Nar), a pummelo peel extract, on LPS-induced PC12 cell apoptosis. Nar pre-conditioning prior to stimulation with LPS for 18 h was a prerequisite for evaluating PC12 cell viability and the protective mechanisms of Nar. Nar significantly improved cell survival in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. On the one hand, Nar downregulated cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), inhibited the release of ROS, mitigated the stimulation of oxidative stress, and rectified the antioxidant protein contents of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD)2 and glutathione synthetase (GSS). On the other hand, Nar downregulated inflammatory gene and protein expression, including interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, HMGB1, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) path-way and downstream mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, activator protein transcription factor-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-kB. Moroever, Nar markedly attenuated the cytochrome c shift from the mitochondria to the cytosol and regulated caspase-3-related protein expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of Nar in neuronal-like PC12 cells. These results suggest that Nar can be utilized as a potential drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

30915128|t|Melatonin receptor depletion suppressed hCG-induced testosterone expression in mouse Leydig cells.
30915128|a|Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 (genes officially named MTNR1A and MTNR1B, respectively) play crucial roles in melatonin-mediated regulation of circadian rhythms, the immune system, and control of reproduction in seasonally breeding animals. In this study, immunolocalization assay showed that MT1 and MT2 are highly expressed in Leydig cell membrane. To understand the biological function of melatonin receptors in hCG-induced testosterone synthesis, we generated melatonin receptor knockdown cells using specific siRNA and performed testosterone detection after hCG treatment. We found that knockdown of melatonin receptors, especially MTNR1A, led to an obvious decrease (> 60%) of testosterone level. Our further study revealed that knockdown of melatonin receptors repressed expression, at both the mRNA level and the protein level, of key steroidogenic genes, such as p450scc, p450c17 and StAR, which are essential for testosterone synthesis. hCG triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to regulate steroidogenic genes' expression and apoptosis. To further investigate the potential roles of melatonin receptors in hCG-induced regulation of ER stress and apoptosis, we examined expression of some crucial ER stress markers, including Grp78, Chop, ATF4, Xbp1, and IRE1. We found that inhibition of melatonin receptors increased hCG-induced expression of Grp78, Chop and ATF4, but not Xbp1 and IRE1, suggesting that hCG may modulate IRE1 signaling pathways in a melatonin receptor-dependent manner. In addition, our further data showed that knockdown of MTNR1A and MTNR1B promoted hCG-induced expression of apoptosis markers, including p53, caspase-3 and Bcl-2. These results suggested that the melatonin receptors MTNR1A and MTNR1B are essential to repress hCG-induced ER stress and cell apoptosis. Our studies demonstrated that the mammalian melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 are involved in testosterone synthesis via mediating multiple cell pathways.

27733623|t|Nebulette is a powerful cytolinker organizing desmin and actin in mouse hearts.
27733623|a|In the hearts of patients bearing nebulette mutations, a severe general disorganization in cardiomyocytes of the extrasarcomeric desmin intermediate filament system is frequently observed. However, the molecular and functional relationship between the desmin cytoskeleton and nebulette-containing sarcomeres is still unclear. Here we report a high-affinity in vitro interaction between nebulette and desmin filaments. A major interaction site has been mapped to the desmin a-helical rod domain, indicating that the filament core is directly involved in the binding of nebulette. The disease-mutant desmin variants E245D and T453I exhibited increased binding affinity for nebulette, delayed filament assembly kinetics, and caused significant weakening of networks. In isolated chick cardiomyocytes and sections from canine heart, we revealed by ground-state depletion and confocal microscopies that module 5 of nebulette extends outward from Z-disk-associated desmin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. Accordingly, in the myocardium of Des(-/-) mice, elevated levels of cardiac actin correlated with alterations in the distribution of nebulette. Our data suggest that a well-organized desmin network is required to accommodate an optimal conformation of nebulette on sarcomeres to bind and recruit cardiac a-actin. Hence we propose that nebulette acts in synergy with nebulin to reinforce and temporally fine-tune striated muscle relaxation-contraction cycles.

19521535|t|Caenorhabditis elegans protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT-5 negatively regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis.
19521535|a|Arginine methylation of histone and non-histone proteins is involved in transcription regulation and many other cellular processes. Nevertheless, whether such protein modification plays a regulatory role during apoptosis remains largely unknown. Here we report that the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of mammalian type II arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 negatively regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We show that inactivation of C. elegans prmt-5 leads to excessive apoptosis in germline following ionizing irradiation, which is due to a CEP-1/p53-dependent up-regulation of the cell death initiator EGL-1. Moreover, we provide evidence that CBP-1, the worm ortholog of human p300/CBP, functions as a cofactor of CEP-1. PRMT-5 forms a complex with both CEP-1 and CBP-1 and can methylate the latter. Importantly, down-regulation of cbp-1 significantly suppresses DNA damage-induced egl-1 expression and apoptosis in prmt-5 mutant worms. These findings suggest that PRMT-5 likely represses CEP-1 transcriptional activity through CBP-1, which represents a novel regulatory mechanism of p53-dependent apoptosis.

26499944|t|HMGB1 promotes HCC progression partly by downregulating p21 via ERK/c-Myc pathway and upregulating MMP-2.
26499944|a|High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was found to be over-expressed in many kinds of human cancer, which binds with several receptors and activates RAGE-Ras-MAPK, Toll-like receptors, NF-kB, and Src family kinase signaling pathways and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, the function and mechanism of HMGB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HMGB1 on HCC progression and explore new molecular mechanism. HMGB1 transient knockdown, stable knockdown, and re-expression were performed by transfection with specific siRNA, shRNA, or expression vector in HCCLM3 cells. Results showed that transient knockdown HMGB1 prevented cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, induced S phase arrest, and inhibited migration and invasion in vitro, and stable knockdown HMGB1 inhibited xenograft growth in Balb/c athymic mice in vivo. Molecular mechanism investigation revealed that knockdown HMGB1 significantly reduced the activation of MAPKs, including ERK1/2, p38, SAPK/JNK, as well as MAPKKs (MEK1/2, SEK1) and its substrates (c-Jun, c-Myc); downregulated NF-kB/p65 expression and phosphorylation level; decreased MMP-2 expression and activity; and upregulated p21 expression. Interestingly, c-Myc was firstly found to be involved in the promoting function of HMGB1 on HCC progression, which provided a novel clue for the inhibitory effect of HMGB1 on p21 expression by a p53-independent pathway. Collectively, these findings indicated that HMGB1 promoted HCC progression partly by enhancing the ERK1/2 and NF-kB pathways, upregulating MMP-2, and downregulating p21 via an ERK/c-Myc pathway.

20507572|t|Differential cytokine regulation by NF-kappaB and AP-1 in Jurkat T-cells.
20507572|a|BACKGROUND: Activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB largely control T-cell activation, following binding of foreign antigens to the T-cell receptor leading to cytokine secretion. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8 are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and AIDS. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-kappaB, in IL-6 and CXCL8 regulation in Jurkat T-cells. RESULTS: Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exposure resulted in an up-regulation of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity, however, exposure to heat killed (HK) Escherichia. coli MG1655 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in NF-kappaB activity without affecting AP-1. The cytokine profile revealed an up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-2 and IL-6 following treatment with both PMA and HK E. coli, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were not affected by PMA but were significantly down-regulated by HK E. coli. AP-1 activation was significantly increased 2 h after PMA exposure and continued to increase thereafter. In contrast, NF-kappaB responded to PMA exposure by a rapid up-regulation followed by a subsequent down-regulation. Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations countered the down-regulation of NF-kappaB by PMA, while similar treatment with calcium ionophore resulted in a reduced NF-kappaB activity following induction with HK E. coli. In order to further study NF-kappaB activation, we considered two up-stream signalling proteins, PKC and Bcl10. Phosphorylated-PKC levels increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli, while Bcl10 levels significantly decreased following PMA treatment. Using an NF-kappaB activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of IL-6 expression while CXCL8 levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA in the presence of JNK-inhibitor suppressed both CXCL8 and IL-6 while PKC-inhibitor primarily decreased CXCL8 expression. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that NF-kappaB regulated IL-6 but not CXCL8. This complex regulation of CXCL8 suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated CXCL8 levels, such as AIDS and autoimmune diseases.

24853300|t|Crucial role of calbindin-D28k in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease mouse model.
24853300|a|Calbindin-D28k (CB), one of the major calcium-binding and buffering proteins, has a critical role in preventing a neuronal death as well as maintaining calcium homeostasis. Although marked reductions of CB expression have been observed in the brains of mice and humans with Alzheimer disease (AD), it is unknown whether these changes contribute to AD-related dysfunction. To determine the pathogenic importance of CB depletions in AD models, we crossed 5 familial AD mutations (5XFAD; Tg) mice with CB knock-out (CBKO) mice and generated a novel line CBKO.5XFAD (CBKOTg) mice. We first identified the change of signaling pathways and differentially expressed proteins globally by removing CB in Tg mice using mass spectrometry and antibody microarray. Immunohistochemistry showed that CBKOTg mice had significant neuronal loss in the subiculum area without changing the magnitude (number) of amyloid b-peptide (Ab) plaques deposition and elicited significant apoptotic features and mitochondrial dysfunction compared with Tg mice. Moreover, CBKOTg mice reduced levels of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 and cAMP response element-binding protein at Ser-133 and synaptic molecules such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDA receptor 1), NMDA receptor 2A, PSD-95 and synaptophysin in the subiculum compared with Tg mice. Importantly, this is the first experimental evidence that removal of CB from amyloid precursor protein/presenilin transgenic mice aggravates AD pathogenesis, suggesting that CB has a critical role in AD pathogenesis.

22876196|t|Minibrain/Dyrk1a regulates food intake through the Sir2-FOXO-sNPF/NPY pathway in Drosophila and mammals.
22876196|a|Feeding behavior is one of the most essential activities in animals, which is tightly regulated by neuroendocrine factors. Drosophila melanogaster short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and the mammalian functional homolog neuropeptide Y (NPY) regulate food intake. Understanding the molecular mechanism of sNPF and NPY signaling is critical to elucidate feeding regulation. Here, we found that minibrain (mnb) and the mammalian ortholog Dyrk1a, target genes of sNPF and NPY signaling, [corrected] regulate food intake in Drosophila melanogaster and mice. In Drosophila melanogaster neuronal cells and mouse hypothalamic cells, sNPF and NPY modulated the mnb and Dyrk1a expression through the PKA-CREB pathway. Increased Dyrk1a activated Sirt1 to regulate the deacetylation of FOXO, which potentiated FOXO-induced sNPF/NPY expression and in turn promoted food intake. Conversely, AKT-mediated insulin signaling suppressed FOXO-mediated sNPF/NPY expression, which resulted in decreasing food intake. Furthermore, human Dyrk1a transgenic mice exhibited decreased FOXO acetylation and increased NPY expression in the hypothalamus, and [corrected] increased food intake. Our findings demonstrate that Mnb/Dyrk1a regulates food intake through the evolutionary conserved Sir2-FOXO-sNPF/NPY pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals.

27102965|t|Artery Tertiary Lymphoid Organs Control Multilayered Territorialized Atherosclerosis B-Cell Responses in Aged ApoE-/- Mice.
27102965|a|OBJECTIVE: Explore aorta B-cell immunity in aged apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Transcript maps, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, immunofluorescence analyses, cell transfers, and Ig-ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot) assays showed multilayered atherosclerosis B-cell responses in artery tertiary lymphoid organs (ATLOs). Aging-associated aorta B-cell-related transcriptomes were identified, and transcript atlases revealed highly territorialized B-cell responses in ATLOs versus atherosclerotic lesions: ATLOs showed upregulation of bona fide B-cell genes, including Cd19, Ms4a1 (Cd20), Cd79a/b, and Ighm although intima plaques preferentially expressed molecules involved in non-B effector responses toward B-cell-derived mediators, that is, Fcgr3 (Cd16), Fcer1g (Cd23), and the C1q family. ATLOs promoted B-cell recruitment. ATLO B-2 B cells included naive, transitional, follicular, germinal center, switched IgG1(+), IgA(+), and IgE(+) memory cells, plasmablasts, and long-lived plasma cells. ATLOs recruited large numbers of B-1 cells whose subtypes were skewed toward interleukin-10(+) B-1b cells versus interleukin-10(-) B-1a cells. ATLO B-1 cells and plasma cells constitutively produced IgM and IgG and a fraction of plasma cells expressed interleukin-10. Moreover, ApoE(-/-) mice showed increased germinal center B cells in renal lymph nodes, IgM-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow, and higher IgM and anti-MDA-LDL (malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein) IgG serum titers. CONCLUSIONS: ATLOs orchestrate dichotomic, territorialized, and multilayered B-cell responses in the diseased aorta; germinal center reactions indicate generation of autoimmune B cells within the diseased arterial wall during aging.

23110133|t|Characterization and identification of subpopulations of mononuclear preosteoclasts induced by TNF-a in combination with TGF-b in rats.
23110133|a|Osteoclasts are unique multinucleated cells formed by fusion of preosteoclasts derived from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, which are induced by RANKL. However, characteristics and subpopulations of osteoclast precursor cells are poorly understood. We show here that a combination of TNF-a, TGF-b, and M-CSF efficiently generates mononuclear preosteoclasts but not multinucleated osteoclasts (MNCs) in rat bone marrow cultures depleted of stromal cells. Using a rat osteoclast-specific mAb, Kat1, we found that TNF-a and TGF-b specifically increased Kat1(+)c-fms(+) and Kat1(+)c-fms(-) cells but not Kat1(-)c-fms(+) cells. Kat1(-)c-fms(+) cells appeared in early stages of culture, but Kat1(+)c-fms(+) and Kat1(+)c-fms(-) cells increased later. Preosteoclasts induced by TNF-a, TGF-b, and M-CSF rapidly differentiated into osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL and hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, suggesting that preosteoclasts are terminally differentiated cells. We further analyzed the expression levels of genes encoding surface proteins in bone marrow macrophages (BMM), preosteoclasts, and MNCs. Preosteoclasts expressed itgam (CD11b) and chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR2; however, in preosteoclasts the expression of chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR2 was not up-regulated compared to their expression in BMM. However, addition of RANKL to preosteoclasts markedly increased the expression of CCR1. In contrast, expression of macrophage antigen emr-1 (F4/80) and chemokine receptor CCR5 was down-regulated in preosteoclasts. The combination of TNF-a, TGF-b, and M-CSF induced Kat1(+)CD11b(+) cells, but these cells were also induced by TNF-a alone. In addition, MIP-1a and MCP-1, which are ligands for CCR1 and CCR2, were chemotactic for preosteoclasts, and promoted multinucleation of preosteoclasts. Finally, we found that Kat1(+)c-fms(+) cells were present in bone tissues of rats with adjuvant arthritis. These data demonstrate that TNF-a in combination with TGF-b efficiently generates preosteoclasts in vitro. We delineated characteristics that are useful for identifying and isolating rat preosteoclasts, and found that CCR1 expression was regulated in the fusion step in osteoclastogenesis.

28224733|t|NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T cells suppress DSS-induced colitis in mice through production of TGF-b.
28224733|a|CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T cells are associated with tumour, infection and autoimmune diseases. Some CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T cells secrete IFN-g and TNF-a to promote inflammation, but others produce TGF-b and FasL to facilitate tumour evasion. Here, murine CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T cells were further classified into NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) and NK1.1(+) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) subpopulations. The frequency of NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells decreased in inflamed colons, whereas more NK1.1(+) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells infiltrated into colons of mice with DSS-induced colitis. NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells expressed TGF-b and FasL without secreting IFN-g, IL-21 and IL-17 and displayed no cytotoxicity. The adoptive transfer of NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells suppressed DSS-induced colitis largely dependent on TGF-b. NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells did not expressed Foxp3, CD223 (LAG-3) and GITR. The subpopulation was distinct from NK1.1(+) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells in terms of surface markers and RNA transcription. NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells also differed from Th2 or Th17 cells because the former did not express GATA-3 and ROR-gt. Thus, NK1.1(-) CD4(+) NKG2D(+) cells exhibited immune regulatory functions, and this T cell subset could be developed to suppress inflammation in clinics.

28581519|t|Autophagy suppresses Ras-driven epithelial tumourigenesis by limiting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.
28581519|a|Activation of Ras signalling occurs in ~30% of human cancers; however, activated Ras alone is not sufficient for tumourigenesis. In a screen for tumour suppressors that cooperate with oncogenic Ras (Ras(V12)) in Drosophila, we identified genes involved in the autophagy pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of human tumours revealed that several core autophagy genes, including GABARAP, correlate with oncogenic KRAS mutations and poor prognosis in human pancreatic cancer, supporting a potential tumour-suppressive effect of the pathway in Ras-driven human cancers. In Drosophila, we demonstrate that blocking autophagy at any step of the pathway enhances Ras(V12)-driven epithelial tissue overgrowth via the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the Jun kinase stress response pathway. Blocking autophagy in Ras(V12) clones also results in non-cell-autonomous effects with autophagy, cell proliferation and caspase activation induced in adjacent wild-type cells. Our study has implications for understanding the interplay between perturbations in Ras signalling and autophagy in tumourigenesis, which might inform the development of novel therapeutics targeting Ras-driven cancers.Oncogene advance online publication, 5 June 2017; doi:10.1038/onc.2017.175.

25182959|t|Mesenchymal stromal cells express GARP/LRRC32 on their surface: effects on their biology and immunomodulatory capacity.
25182959|a|Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a promising tool for therapy in regenerative medicine, transplantation, and autoimmune disease due to their trophic and immunomodulatory activities. However, we are still far from understanding the mechanisms of action of MSCs in these processes. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in MSC migration, differentiation, and immunomodulation. Recently, glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) was shown to bind latency-associated peptide (LAP)/TGF-b1 to the cell surface of activated Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and megakaryocytes/platelets. In this manuscript, we show that human and mouse MSCs express GARP which presents LAP/TGF-b1 on their cell surface. Silencing GARP expression in MSCs increased their secretion and activation of TGF-b1 and reduced their proliferative capacity in a TGF-b1-independent manner. Importantly, we showed that GARP expression on MSCs contributed to their ability to inhibit T-cell responses in vitro. In summary, we have found that GARP is an essential molecule for MSC biology, regulating their immunomodulatory and proliferative activities. We envision GARP as a new target for improving the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs and also as a novel MSC marker.

28428259|t|RABL2 interacts with the intraflagellar transport-B complex and CEP19 and participates in ciliary assembly.
28428259|a|Proteins localized to the basal body and the centrosome play crucial roles in ciliary assembly and function. Although RABL2 and CEP19 are conserved in ciliated organisms and have been implicated in ciliary/flagellar functions, their roles are poorly understood. Here we show that RABL2 interacts with CEP19 and is recruited to the mother centriole and basal body in a CEP19-dependent manner and that CEP19 is recruited to the centriole probably via its binding to the centrosomal protein FGFR1OP. Disruption of the RABL2 gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii results in the nonflagellated phenotype, suggesting a crucial role of RABL2 in ciliary/flagellar assembly. We also show that RABL2 interacts, in its GTP-bound state, with the intraflagellar transport (IFT)-B complex via the IFT74-IFT81 heterodimer and that the interaction is disrupted by a mutation found in male infertile mice (Mot mice) with a sperm flagella motility defect. Intriguingly, RABL2 binds to CEP19 and the IFT74-IFT81 heterodimer in a mutually exclusive manner. Furthermore, exogenous expression of the GDP-locked or Mot-type RABL2 mutant in human cells results in mild defects in ciliary assembly. These results indicate that RABL2 localized to the basal body plays crucial roles in ciliary/flagellar assembly via its interaction with the IFT-B complex.

30280191|t|Overexpression of small ubiquitin-like modifier 2 ameliorates high glucose-induced reductions in cardiomyocyte proliferation via the transforming growth factor-beta/Smad pathway.
30280191|a|Hyperglycemia may induce diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC). In the current study, the mechanism underlying the alleviation of high glucose (HG)-induced impairments in the proliferation of H9c2 embryo cardiomyocyte proliferation by small ubiquitin-like modifier 2 (SUMO2) overexpression was investigated. H9c2 cell morphology was identified as classical long shuttle type by optical microscopy. The viability of HG-injured H9c2 cells was evaluated by a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and the results indicated that viability was inhibited in a dose-dependent (5.6, 10, 20 and 30 mmol/l) and time-dependent (6, 12 and 24 h) manner. H9c2 cells treated with 20 mmol/l HG for 24 h were selected for subsequent experiments due to the extent of injury caused at a low density. Flow cytometry was conducted to confirm cell cycle arrest between G1/S phases and apoptosis promotion in HG-injured H9c2 cells, and the subsequent alleviating effect of SUMO2 overexpression on these HG-induced effects. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression levels of cell cycle-and apoptosis-associated factors. The results indicated that the expression ofthe cell cycle-associated factors CyclinA2 and C-Myc was upregulated, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a was downregulated. The expression of the apoptosis-associated factor Bcl-2 was upregulated, while Bcl-2-associated X and caspase-3 expression was downregulated, by SUMO2 overexpression. Furthermore, the effect of SUMO2 overexpression on the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/Smad pathway was also determined using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The results indicated the mRNA and protein levels of TGF-beta1 and Smad3 in HG-injured H9c2 cells were significantly decreased following SUMO2 overexpression. Thus, the results demonstrated that overexpression of SUMO2 may alleviate H9c2 cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest and apoptosis promotion induced by HG via regulation of cell cycle- and apoptosis-associated factors, as well as inhibition of the TGF-beta/Smad pathway. These results may therefore provide a novel strategy for the protection of cardiomyocytes and may aid the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with DC.

27542238|t|A steroid like phytochemical Antcin M is an anti-aging reagent that eliminates hyperglycemia-accelerated premature senescence in dermal fibroblasts by direct activation of Nrf2 and SIRT-1.
27542238|a|The present study revealed the anti-aging properties of antcin M (ANM) and elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the effects. We found that exposure of human normal dermal fibroblasts (HNDFs) to high-glucose (HG, 30 mM) for 3 days, accelerated G0/G1 phase arrest and senescence. Indeed, co-treatment with ANM (10 microM) significantly attenuated HG-induced growth arrest and promoted cell proliferation. Further molecular analysis revealed that ANM blocked the HG-induced reduction in G1-S transition regulatory proteins such as cyclin D, cyclin E, CDK4, CDK6, CDK2 and protein retinoblastoma (pRb). In addition, treatment with ANM eliminated HG-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the induction of anti-oxidant genes, HO-1 and NQO-1 via transcriptional activation of Nrf2. Moreover, treatment with ANM abolished HG-induced SIPS as evidenced by reduced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity. This effect was further confirmed by reduction in senescence-associated marker proteins including, p21CIP1, p16INK4A, and p53/FoxO1 acetylation. Also, the HG-induced decline in aging-related marker protein SMP30 was rescued by ANM. Furthermore, treatment with ANM increased SIRT-1 expression, and prevented SIRT-1 depletion. This protection was consistent with inhibition of SIRT-1 phosphorylation at Ser47 followed by blocking its upstream kinases, p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK. Further analysis revealed that ANM partially protected HG-induced senescence in SIRT-1 silenced cells. A similar effect was also observed in Nrf2 silenced cells. However, a complete loss of protection was observed in both Nrf2 and SIRT-1 knockdown cells suggesting that both induction of Nrf2-mediated anti-oxidant defense and SIRT-1-mediated deacetylation activity contribute to the anti-aging properties of ANM in vitro. Result of in vivo studies shows that ANM-treated C. elegens exhibits an increased survival rate during HG-induced oxidative stress insult. Furthermore, ANM significantly extended the life span of C. elegans. Taken together, our results suggest the potential application of ANM in age-related diseases or as a preventive reagent against aging process.

19427096|t|Hematopoietic- and neurologic-expressed sequence 1 (Hn1) depletion in B16.F10 melanoma cells promotes a differentiated phenotype that includes increased melanogenesis and cell cycle arrest.
19427096|a|The Hematopoietic- and neurologic-expressed sequence 1 (Hn1) gene encodes a small protein that is highly conserved among species. Hn1 expression is upregulated in regenerating neural tissues, including the axotomized adult rodent facial motor nerve and dedifferentiating retinal pigment epithelial cells of the Japanese newt. It is also expressed in numerous tissues during embryonic development as well as in regions of the adult brain that exhibit high plasticity. Hn1 has also been reported as a marker for human ovarian carcinoma and it is expressed in high-grade human gliomas. This study was directed toward understanding the function of Hn1 in a murine melanoma cell line. Hn1 mRNA and protein were identified in B16.F10 cells and in tumors formed from these cells. Inhibition of Hn1 protein expression with siRNA increased melanogenesis. Hn1-depleted cells expressed higher levels of the melanogenic proteins tyrosinase and Trp2 and an increased interaction between actin and Rab27a. The in vitro cell growth rate of Hn1-depleted cells was significantly reduced due to G1/S cell cycle arrest. This was consistent with a reduction in the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein as well as lower levels of p27 and increased expression of p21. Decreased expression of c-Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, was also detected in the Hn1-depleted cells, however HGF-dependent stimulation of phosphorylated-ERK was unaffected. Hn1 depletion also led to increased basal levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, while basal ERK phosphorylation was reduced. Moreover, Hn1-depleted cells had reduced expression of transcription factors MITF and USF-1, and increased expression of TFE3. These data, coupled with reports on Hn1 expression in regeneration and development, suggest that Hn1 functions as a suppressor of differentiation in cells undergoing repair or proliferation.

23991091|t|MiR-155 has a protective role in the development of non-alcoholic hepatosteatosis in mice.
23991091|a|Hepatic steatosis is a global epidemic that is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. MicroRNAs (miRs) are regulators that can functionally integrate a range of metabolic and inflammatory pathways in liver. We aimed to investigate the functional role of miR-155 in hepatic steatosis. Male C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and miR-155(-/-) mice were fed either normal chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 6 months then lipid levels, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were assessed in livers and serum of the mice. Mice lacking endogenous miR-155 that were fed HFD for 6 months developed increased hepatic steatosis compared to WT controls. This was associated with increased liver weight and serum VLDL/LDL cholesterol and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, as well as increased hepatic expression of genes involved in glucose regulation (Pck1, Cebpa), fatty acid uptake (Cd36) and lipid metabolism (Fasn, Fabp4, Lpl, Abcd2, Pla2g7). Using miRNA target prediction algorithms and the microarray transcriptomic profile of miR-155(-/-) livers, we identified and validated that Nr1h3 (LXRa) as a direct miR-155 target gene that is potentially responsible for the liver phenotype of miR-155(-/-) mice. Together these data indicate that miR-155 plays a pivotal role regulating lipid metabolism in liver and that its deregulation may lead to hepatic steatosis in patients with diabetes.

28684635|t|A Type 2 Diabetes-Associated Functional Regulatory Variant in a Pancreatic Islet Enhancer at the ADCY5 Locus.
28684635|a|Molecular mechanisms remain unknown for most type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study identified loci. Variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose levels reside in introns of ADCY5, a gene that encodes adenylate cyclase 5. Adenylate cyclase 5 catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP, which is a second messenger molecule involved in cell signaling and pancreatic b-cell insulin secretion. We demonstrated that type 2 diabetes risk alleles are associated with decreased ADCY5 expression in human islets and examined candidate variants for regulatory function. rs11708067 overlaps a predicted enhancer region in pancreatic islets. The type 2 diabetes risk rs11708067-A allele showed fewer H3K27ac ChIP-seq reads in human islets, lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays in rodent b-cells (rat 832/13 and mouse MIN6), and increased nuclear protein binding compared with the rs11708067-G allele. Homozygous deletion of the orthologous enhancer region in 832/13 cells resulted in a 64% reduction in expression level of Adcy5, but not adjacent gene Sec22a, and a 39% reduction in insulin secretion. Together, these data suggest that rs11708067-A risk allele contributes to type 2 diabetes by disrupting an islet enhancer, which results in reduced ADCY5 expression and impaired insulin secretion.

26065826|t|MAPK signaling downstream to TLR4 contributes to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.
26065826|a|Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been implicated as a locus for initiation of paclitaxel related chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). This project explores the involvement of the immediate down-stream signal molecules in inducing paclitaxel CIPN. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) were measured in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal cord over time using Western blot and immunohistochemistry in a rat model of paclitaxel CIPN. The effects of MAPK inhibitors in preventing and reversing behavioral signs of CIPN were also measured (group sizes 4-9). Extracellular signal related kinase (ERK1/2) and P38 but not c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) or PI3K-Akt signaling expression was increased in DRG. Phospho-ERK1/2 staining was co-localized to small CGRP-positive DRG neurons in cell profiles surrounding large DRG neurons consistent with satellite glial cells. The expression of phospho-P38 was co-localized to small IB4-positive and CGRP-positive DRG neurons. The TLR4 antagonist LPS derived from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (LPS-RS) inhibited paclitaxel-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38. The MAPK inhibitors PD98059 (MEK1/2), U0126 (MEK1/2) and SB203580 (P38) prevented but did not reverse paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivity. Paclitaxel treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Inhibitor alpha of NFkappaB (IkappaBalpha) in DRG resulting in an apparent release of NFkappaB from the IkappaBalpha-NFkappaB complex as increased expression of nuclear NFkappaB was also observed. LPS-RS inhibited paclitaxel-induced translocation of NFkappaB in DRG. No change was observed in spinal NFkappaB. These results implicate TLR4 signaling via MAP kinases and NFkappaB in the induction and maintenance of paclitaxel-related CIPN.

28082458|t|Developmental Role of Macrophage Cannabinoid-1 Receptor Signaling in Type-2 Diabetes.
28082458|a|Islet inflammation promotes b-cell loss and type-2 diabetes (T2D), a process replicated in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats in which b-cell loss has been linked to cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R)-induced pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages infiltrating pancreatic islets. Here, we analyzed CB1R signaling in macrophages and its developmental role in T2Da. ZDF rats with global deletion of CB1R are protected from b-cell loss, hyperglycemia and nephropathy present in ZDF littermates. Adoptive transfer of CB1R(-/-) bone marrow to ZDF rats also prevents b-cell loss and hyperglycemia, but not nephropathy. ZDF islets contain elevated levels of CB1R, IL-1b, TNF-a, the chemokine CCL2 and interferon regulatory factor-5 (IRF5), a marker of M1 inflammatory macrophage polarization. In primary cultured rodent and human macrophages, CB1R activation increased Irf5 expression, whereas knockdown of Irf5 blunted CB1R-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines without affecting CCL2 expression, which was p38MAPKa-dependent. Macrophage-specific in vivo knockdown of Irf5 protected ZDF rats from b-cell loss and hyperglycemia. Thus, IRF5 is a crucial downstream mediator of diabetogenic CB1R signaling in macrophages and a potential therapeutic target.

28347651|t|Selective Targeting of SH2 Domain-Phosphotyrosine Interactions of Src Family Tyrosine Kinases with Monobodies.
28347651|a|The binding of Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains to phosphotyrosine (pY) sites is critical for the autoinhibition and substrate recognition of the eight Src family kinases (SFKs). The high sequence conservation of the 120 human SH2 domains poses a significant challenge to selectively perturb the interactions of even the SFK SH2 family against the rest of the SH2 domains. We have developed synthetic binding proteins, termed monobodies, for six of the SFK SH2 domains with nanomolar affinity. Most of these monobodies competed with pY ligand binding and showed strong selectivity for either the SrcA (Yes, Src, Fyn, Fgr) or SrcB subgroup (Lck, Lyn, Blk, Hck). Interactome analysis of intracellularly expressed monobodies revealed that they bind SFKs but no other SH2-containing proteins. Three crystal structures of monobody-SH2 complexes unveiled different and only partly overlapping binding modes, which rationalized the observed selectivity and enabled structure-based mutagenesis to modulate inhibition mode and selectivity. In line with the critical roles of SFK SH2 domains in kinase autoinhibition and T-cell receptor signaling, monobodies binding the Src and Hck SH2 domains selectively activated respective recombinant kinases, whereas an Lck SH2-binding monobody inhibited proximal signaling events downstream of the T-cell receptor complex. Our results show that SFK SH2 domains can be targeted with unprecedented potency and selectivity using monobodies. They are excellent tools for dissecting SFK functions in normal development and signaling and to interfere with aberrant SFK signaling networks in cancer cells.

25315346|t|Rac1 signaling is critical to cardiomyocyte polarity and embryonic heart development.
25315346|a|BACKGROUND: Defects in cardiac septation are the most common form of congenital heart disease, but the mechanisms underlying these defects are still poorly understood. The small GTPase Rac1 is implicated in planar cell polarity of epithelial cells in Drosophila; however, its role in mammalian cardiomyocyte polarity is not clear. We tested the hypothesis that Rac1 signaling in the second heart field regulates cardiomyocyte polarity, chamber septation, and right ventricle development during embryonic heart development. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with second heart field-specific deficiency of Rac1 (Rac1(SHF)) exhibited ventricular and atrial septal defects, a thinner right ventricle myocardium, and a bifid cardiac apex. Fate-mapping analysis showed that second heart field contribution to the interventricular septum and right ventricle was deficient in Rac1(SHF) hearts. Notably, cardiomyocytes had a spherical shape with disrupted F-actin filaments in Rac1(SHF) compared with elongated and well-aligned cardiomyocytes in littermate controls. Expression of Scrib, a core protein in planar cell polarity, was lost in Rac1(SHF) hearts with decreased expression of WAVE and Arp2/3, leading to decreased migratory ability. In addition, Rac1-deficient neonatal cardiomyocytes displayed defects in cell projections, lamellipodia formation, and cell elongation. Furthermore, apoptosis was increased and the expression of Gata4, Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and Hand2 transcription factors was decreased in the Rac1(SHF) right ventricle myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of Rac1 in the second heart field impairs elongation and cytoskeleton organization of cardiomyocytes and results in congenital septal defects, thin right ventricle myocardium, and a bifid cardiac apex. Our study suggests that Rac1 signaling is critical to cardiomyocyte polarity and embryonic heart development.

24477591|t|The -930A>G polymorphism of the CYBA gene is associated with premature coronary artery disease. A case-control study and gene-risk factors interactions.
24477591|a|Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). NADPH oxidases are the main source of ROS in the vasculature. p22phox is a critical component of vascular NADPH oxidases and is encoded by the CYBA (cytochrome b245 alpha) gene. The -930A>G CYBA polymorphism (rs9932581:A>G) modulates the activity of the CYBA promoter, and influences CYBA transcriptional activity. The aim of the present study was to analyze a possible association between the -930A>G polymorphism and CAD and to search for gene-traditional risk factors interactions. 480 subjects were studied: 240 patients with premature CAD, 240 age and sex matched blood donors. The -930A>G polymorphism was genotyped using the TaqMan - Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems). The -930G allele carrier state was a risk factor for CAD (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.21-3.44, P=0.007). A synergistic effect of the -930G allele with overweight/obesity (BMI --25) and cigarette smoking was found. The estimated CAD risk for BMI --25 and the -930G allele interaction was about 160% greater than that predicted by assuming additivity of the effects, and about 40% greater for interaction of cigarette smoking and the -930G allele. Overweight/obesity was a risk factor for CAD only in the -930G allele carriers (P<10(-10)) but not in the AA homozygotes (P=1.00). In conclusion the -930A>G CYBA polymorphism is associated with CAD in the Polish population. The -930G allele carriers are particularly at risk of consequences of obesity and tobacco smoke exposure.

23474756|t|Aberrant Mer receptor tyrosine kinase expression contributes to leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia.
23474756|a|Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to be extremely difficult to treat successfully, and the unacceptably low overall survival rates mandate that we assess new potential therapies to ameliorate poor clinical response to conventional therapy. Abnormal tyrosine kinase activation in AML has been associated with poor prognosis and provides strategic targets for novel therapy development. We found that Mer receptor tyrosine kinase was over-expressed in a majority of pediatric (29/36, 80%) and adult (10/10, 100%) primary AML patient blasts at the time of diagnosis, and 100% of patient samples at the time of relapse. Mer was also found to be expressed in 12 of 14 AML cell lines (86%). In contrast, normal bone marrow myeloid precursors expressed little to no Mer. Following AML cell line stimulation with Gas6, a Mer ligand, we observed activation of prosurvival and proliferative signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, MSK1, CREB, ATF1, AKT and STAT6. To assess the phenotypic role of Mer in AML, two independent short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were used to decrease Mer expression in the AML cell lines Nomo-1 and Kasumi-1. Reduction of Mer protein levels significantly increased rates of myeloblast apoptosis two to threefold in response to serum starvation. Furthermore, myeloblasts with knocked-down Mer demonstrated decreased colony formation by 67-87%, relative to control cell lines (P<0.01). NOD-SCID-gamma mice transplanted with Nomo-1 myeloblasts with reduced levels of Mer had a significant prolongation in survival compared with mice transplanted with the parental or control cell lines (median survival 17 days in parental and control cell lines, versus 32-36 days in Mer knockdown cell lines, P<0.0001). These data suggest a role for Mer in acute myeloid leukemogenesis and indicate that targeted inhibition of Mer may be an effective therapeutic strategy in pediatric and adult AML.

21159167|t|Blocking of ERK1 and ERK2 sensitizes human mesothelioma cells to doxorubicin.
21159167|a|BACKGROUND: Malignant mesotheliomas (MM) have a poor prognosis, largely because of their chemoresistance to anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin (Dox). Here we show using human MM lines that Dox activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and 2), causally linked to increased expression of ABC transporter genes, decreased accumulation of Dox, and enhanced MM growth. Using the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 and stably transfected shERK1 and shERK2 MM cell lines, we show that inhibition of both ERK1 and 2 sensitizes MM cells to Dox. RESULTS: U0126 significantly modulated endogenous expression of several important drug resistance (BCL2, ABCB1, ABCC3), prosurvival (BCL2), DNA repair (BRCA1, BRCA2), hormone receptor (AR, ESR2, PPARgamma) and drug metabolism (CYP3A4) genes newly identified in MM cells. In comparison to shControl lines, MM cell lines stably transfected with shERK1 or shERK2 exhibited significant increases in intracellular accumulation of Dox and decreases in cell viability. Affymetrix microarray analysis on stable shERK1 and shERK2 MM lines showed more than 2-fold inhibition (p    <= 0.05) of expression of ATP binding cassette genes (ABCG1, ABCA5, ABCA2, MDR/TAP, ABCA1, ABCA8, ABCC2) in comparison to shControl lines. Moreover, injection of human MM lines into SCID mice showed that stable shERK1 or shERK2 lines had significantly slower tumor growth rates in comparison to shControl lines after Dox treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that blocking ERK1 and 2, which play critical roles in multi-drug resistance and survival, may be beneficial in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of MMs and other tumors.

23640975|t|PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502 antitumor activity is enhanced with induction of wild-type TP53 in human xenograft and murine knockout models of head and neck cancer.
23640975|a|PURPOSE: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation is often associated with altered expression or mutations of PIK3CA, TP53/p73, PTEN, and TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR) in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). However, little is known about how these alterations affect response to PI3K/mTOR-targeted agents. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this preclinical study, PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling was characterized in nine HNSCC (UM-SCC) cell lines and human oral keratinocytes. We investigated the molecular and anticancer effects of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502(PF-502) in UM-SCC expressing PIK3CA with decreased wild-type TP53, mutant TP53-/+ mutantTGFBR2, and in HNSCC of a conditional Pten/Tgfbr1 double knockout mouse model displaying PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation. RESULTS: UM-SCC showed increased PIK3CA expression and Akt/mTOR activation, and PF-502 inhibited PI3K/mTORC1/2 targets. In human HNSCC expressing PIK3CA and decreased wtTP53 and p73, PF-502 reciprocally enhanced TP53/p73 expression and growth inhibition, which was partially reversible by p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha. Most UM-SCC with wtTP53 exhibited a lower IC50 than those with mtTP53 status. PF-502 blocked growth in G0-G1 and increased apoptotic sub-G0 DNA. PF-502 suppressed tumorigenesis and showed combinatorial activity with radiation in a wild-type TP53 UM-SCC xenograft model. PF-502 also significantly delayed HNSCC tumorigenesis and prolonged survival of Pten/Tgfbr1-deficient mice. Significant inhibition of p-Akt, p-4EBP1, p-S6, and Ki67, as well as increased p53 and TUNEL were observed in tumor specimens. CONCLUSIONS: PI3K-mTOR inhibition can enhance TP53/p73 expression and significantly inhibit tumor growth alone or when combined with radiation in HNSCC with wild-type TP53. PIK3CA, TP53/p73, PTEN, and TGF-beta alterations are potential modifiers of response and merit investigation in future clinical trials with PI3K-mTOR inhibitors.

27084744|t|NOTCH1 and SOX10 are Essential for Proliferation and Radiation Resistance of Cancer Stem-Like Cells in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.
27084744|a|PURPOSE: Although the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been proposed, lack of assays for their propagation and uncertainty about molecular markers prevented their characterization. Our objective was to isolate CSC from ACC and provide insight into signaling pathways that support their propagation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To isolate CSC from ACC and characterize them, we used ROCK inhibitor-supplemented cell culture, immunomagnetic cell sorting, andin vitro/in vivoassays for CSC viability and tumorigenicity. RESULTS: We identified in ACC CD133-positive CSC that expressed NOTCH1 and SOX10, formed spheroids, and initiated tumors in nude mice. CD133(+)ACC cells produced activated NOTCH1 (N1ICD) and generated CD133(-)cells that expressed JAG1 as well as neural differentiation factors NR2F1, NR2F2, and p27Kip1. Knockdowns ofNOTCH1, SOX10, and their common effectorFABP7had negative effects on each other, inhibited spheroidogenesis, and induced cell death pointing at their essential roles in CSC maintenance. Downstream effects ofFABP7knockdown included suppression of a broad spectrum of genes involved in proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism. Among proliferation-linked NOTCH1/FABP7 targets, we identified SKP2 and its substrate p27Kip1. A g-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depleted CD133(+)cells, suppressed N1ICD and SKP2, induced p27Kip1, inhibited ACC growthin vivo, and sensitized CD133(+)cells to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish in the majority of ACC the presence of a previously uncharacterized population of CD133(+)cells with neural stem properties, which are driven by SOX10, NOTCH1, and FABP7. Sensitivity of these cells to Notch inhibition and their dependence on SKP2 offer new opportunities for targeted ACC therapies.

24442316|t|Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis protects liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in acute liver injured mice.
24442316|a|Cultured mycelium Cordyceps sinensis (CMCS) was widely used for a variety of diseases including liver injury, the current study aims to investigate the protective effects of CMCS on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in acute injury liver and related action mechanisms. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-galactosamine (D-GalN). 39 male BABL/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal control, model control, CMCS treatment and 1,10-phenanthroline treatment groups. The Serum liver function parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were assayed with the commercial kit. The inflammation and scaffold structure in liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and silver staining respectively. The LSECs and sub-endothelial basement membrane were observed with the scanning and transmission electronic microscope. The protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in liver were analyzed with Western blotting. Expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was investigated with immunofluorescence staining. The lipid peroxidation indicators including antisuperoxideanion (ASAFR), hydroxyl free radical (.OH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were determined with kits, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2/9) activities in liver were analyzed with gelatin zymography and in situ fluorescent zymography respectively. The model mice had much higher serum levels of ALT and AST than the normal mice. Compared to that in the normal control, more severe liver inflammation and hepatocyte apoptosis, worse hepatic lipid peroxidation demonstrated by the increased ASAFR, .OH and MDA, but decreased SOD and GST, increased MMP-2/9 activities and VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and vWF expressions, which revealed obvious LSEC injury and scaffold structure broken, were shown in the model control. Compared with the model group, CMCS and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly improved serum ALT/AST, attenuated hepatic inflammation and improved peroxidative injury in liver, decreased MMP-2/9 activities in liver tissue, improved integration of scaffold structure, and decreased protein expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. CMCS could protect LSECs from injury and maintain the microvasculature integration in acute injured liver of mice induced by LPS/D-GalN. Its action mechanism was associated with the down-regulation of MMP-2/9 activities and inhibition of peroxidation in injured liver.

29054964|t|Gene expression profiling of the Notch-AhR-IL22 axis at homeostasis and in response to tissue injury.
29054964|a|Notch and Interleukin-22 signaling are known to regulate tissue homeostasis and response to injury in humans and mice, and the induction of endogenous arylhydrocarbon receptor ligands through Notch links the two pathways in a hierarchical fashion. However, in adults the species-, organ- and injury-specific gene expression of the Notch-AhR-IL22 axis components is unknown. We therefore performed gene expression profiling of DLL1, DLL3, DLL4, DLK1, DLK2, JAG1, JAG2, Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4, ADAM17/TACE, PSEN1, BSG/CD147, RBP-J, HES1, HES5, HEY1, HEYL, AHR, ARNT, ARNT2, CYP1A1, CYP24A1, IL22, IL22RA1, IL22RA2, IL10RB, and STAT3 under homeostatic conditions in 10 mature murine and human organs. Additionally, the expression of these genes was assessed in murine models of acute sterile inflammation and progressive fibrosis. We show that there are organ specific gene expression profiles of the Notch-AhR-IL22 axis in humans and mice. Although there is an overall interspecies congruency, specific differences between human and murine expression signatures do exist. In murine tissues with AHR/ARNT expression CYP1A1 and IL22 were correlated with HES5 and HEYL expression, while in human tissues no such correlation was found. Notch- and AhR-signaling are involved in renal inflammation and fibrosis with specific gene expression changes in each model. Despite the presence of all Notch pathway molecules in the kidney and a model-specific induction of Notch ligands, IL22 was only upregulated in acute inflammation, but rapidly downregulated during regeneration. This implies that for targeting injury responses e.g. via Interleukin-22, species-specific differences, injury-type and timepoints have to be considered.

28242692|t|LEM2 recruits CHMP7 for ESCRT-mediated nuclear envelope closure in fission yeast and human cells.
28242692|a|Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport III (ESCRT-III) proteins have been implicated in sealing the nuclear envelope in mammals, spindle pole body dynamics in fission yeast, and surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast. Here, we report that Lem2p (LEM2), a member of the LEM (Lap2-Emerin-Man1) family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein Cmp7p (CHMP7), work together to recruit additional ESCRT-III proteins to holes in the nuclear membrane. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, deletion of the ATPase vps4 leads to severe defects in nuclear morphology and integrity. These phenotypes are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations that arise spontaneously in lem2 or cmp7, implying that these proteins may function upstream in the same pathway. Building on these genetic interactions, we explored the role of LEM2 during nuclear envelope reformation in human cells. We found that CHMP7 and LEM2 enrich at the same region of the chromatin disk periphery during this window of cell division and that CHMP7 can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of LEM2 in vitro. We further found that, during nuclear envelope formation, recruitment of the ESCRT factors CHMP7, CHMP2A, and IST1/CHMP8 all depend on LEM2 in human cells. We conclude that Lem2p/LEM2 is a conserved nuclear site-specific adaptor that recruits Cmp7p/CHMP7 and downstream ESCRT factors to the nuclear envelope.

27860245|t|Telocytes: a potential defender in the spleen of Npc1 mutant mice.
27860245|a|Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (Npc1), is an atypical lysosomal storage disorder caused by autosomal recessive inheritance of mutations in Npc1 gene. In the Npc1 mutant mice (Npc1(-/-) ), the initial manifestation is enlarged spleen, concomitant with free cholesterol accumulation. Telocytes (TCs), a novel type of interstitial cell, exist in a variety of tissues including spleen, presumably thought to be involved in many biological processes such as nursing stem cells and recruiting inflammatory cells. In this study, we found that the spleen is significantly enlarged in Npc1(-/-) mice, and the results from transmission electron microscopy examination and immunostaining using three different TCs markers, c-Kit, CD34 and Vimentin revealed significantly increased splenic TCs in Npc1(-/-) mice. Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cells and macrophages were also elevated in Npc1(-/-) spleen. Taken together, our data indicate that splenic TCs might alleviate the progress of splenic malfunction via recruiting hematopoietic stem cells and macrophages.

21391871|t|Renal pro-apoptotic proteins are reduced by growth hormone resistance but not by visceral fat removal.
21391871|a|Growth hormone (GH) receptor knockout (GHRKO) mice are highly insulin sensitive and long-lived. Surgical visceral fat removal (VFR) improves insulin signaling in normal mice and rats and extends longevity in rats. We have previously demonstrated decreased expression of certain pro-apoptotic genes in kidneys of GHRKO mice and suggested that this could contribute to the increased longevity of these animals. The aim of the present study was to examine the level of the following proteins: caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-8, bax, bad, phospho-bad, bcl-2, Smac/DIABLO, Apaf-1, phospho-p53 (pp53) and cytochrome c in male GHRKO and normal (N) mice subjected to VFR or sham surgery, at approximately six months of age. The kidneys were collected two months after VFR. Caspase-3, caspase-8, bax, bad, Smac/DIABLO, Apaf-1 and pp53 levels were decreased in GHRKO mice as compared to N animals. VFR did not change the level of any of the examined proteins. The decreased renal levels of pro-apoptotic proteins could contribute to the extended life-span caused by targeted disruption of the GH receptor gene but are apparently not involved in mediating the effects of VFR.

28759611|t|TPL-2 restricts Ccl24-dependent immunity to Heligmosomoides polygyrus.
28759611|a|TPL-2 (COT, MAP3K8) kinase activates the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway in innate immune responses following TLR, TNFR1 and IL-1R stimulation. TPL-2 contributes to type-1/Th17-mediated autoimmunity and control of intracellular pathogens. We recently demonstrated TPL-2 reduces severe airway allergy to house dust mite by negatively regulating type-2 responses. In the present study, we found that TPL-2 deficiency resulted in resistance to Heligmosomoides polygyrus infection, with accelerated worm expulsion, reduced fecal egg burden and reduced worm fitness. Using co-housing experiments, we found resistance to infection in TPL-2 deficient mice (Map3k8-/-) was independent of microbiota alterations in H. polygyrus infected WT and Map3k8-/-mice. Additionally, our data demonstrated immunity to H. polygyrus infection in TPL-2 deficient mice was not due to dysregulated type-2 immune responses. Genome-wide analysis of intestinal tissue from infected TPL-2-deficient mice identified elevated expression of genes involved in chemotaxis and homing of leukocytes and cells, including Ccl24 and alternatively activated genes. Indeed, Map3k8-/-mice had a significant influx of eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes and Il4GFP+ T cells. Conditional knockout experiments demonstrated that specific deletion of TPL-2 in CD11c+ cells, but not Villin+ epithelial cells, LysM+ myeloid cells or CD4+ T cells, led to accelerated resistance to H. polygyrus. In line with a central role of CD11c+ cells, CD11c+ CD11b+ cells isolated from TPL-2-deficient mice had elevated Ccl24. Finally, Ccl24 neutralization in TPL-2 deficient mice significantly decreased the expression of Arg1, Retnla, Chil3 and Ear11 correlating with a loss of resistance to H. polygyrus. These observations suggest that TPL-2-regulated Ccl24 in CD11c+CD11b+ cells prevents accelerated type-2 mediated immunity to H. polygyrus. Collectively, this study identifies a previously unappreciated role for TPL-2 controlling immune responses to H. polygyrus infection by restricting Ccl24 production.

28381574|t|Defining a Novel Role for the Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor in Human Adenovirus Serotype 5 Transduction In Vitro in the Presence of Mouse Serum.
28381574|a|Human adenoviral serotype 5 (HAdV-5) vectors have predominantly hepatic tropism when delivered intravascularly, resulting in immune activation and toxicity. Coagulation factor X (FX) binding to HAdV-5 mediates liver transduction and provides protection from virion neutralization in mice. FX is dispensable for liver transduction in mice lacking IgM antibodies or complement, suggesting that alternative transduction pathways exist. To identify novel factor(s) mediating HAdV-5 FX-independent entry, we investigated HAdV-5 transduction in vitro in the presence of serum from immunocompetent C57BL/6 or immunocompromised mice lacking IgM antibodies (Rag 2(-/-) and NOD-scid-gamma [NSG]). Sera from all three mouse strains enhanced HAdV-5 transduction of A549 cells. While inhibition of HAdV-5-FX interaction with FX-binding protein (X-bp) inhibited transduction in the presence of C57BL/6 serum, it had negligible effect on the enhanced transduction observed in the presence of Rag 2(-/-) or NSG serum. Rag 2(-/-) serum also enhanced transduction of the FX binding-deficient HAdV-5HVR5*HVR7*E451Q (AdT*). Interestingly, Rag 2(-/-) serum enhanced HAdV-5 transduction in a FX-independent manner in CHO-CAR and SKOV3-CAR cells (CHO or SKOV3 cells transfected to stably express human coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor [CAR]). Additionally, blockade of CAR with soluble HAdV-5 fiber knob inhibited mouse serum-enhanced transduction in A549 cells, suggesting a potential role for CAR. Transduction of HAdV-5 KO1 and HAdV-5/F35 (CAR binding deficient) in the presence of Rag 2(-/-) serum was equivalent to that of HAdV-5, indicating that direct interaction between HAdV-5 and CAR is not required. These data suggest that FX may protect HAdV-5 from neutralization but has minimal contribution to HAdV-5 transduction in the presence of immunocompromised mouse serum. Alternatively, transduction occurs via an unidentified mouse serum protein capable of bridging HAdV-5 to CAR.IMPORTANCE The intravascular administration of HAdV-5 vectors can result in acute liver toxicity, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and injury to the vascular endothelium, illustrating challenges yet to overcome for HAdV-5-mediated systemic gene therapy. The finding that CAR and potentially an unidentified factor present in mouse serum might be important mediators of HAdV-5 transduction highlights that a better understanding of the complex biology defining the interplay between adenovirus immune recognition and cellular uptake mechanisms is still required. These findings are important to inform future optimization and development of HAdV-5-based adenoviral vectors for gene therapy.

19358334|t|Thymosin beta4 mediated PKC activation is essential to initiate the embryonic coronary developmental program and epicardial progenitor cell activation in adult mice in vivo.
19358334|a|Hypoxic heart disease is a predominant cause of disability and death worldwide. Since adult mammalian hearts are incapable of regeneration after hypoxia, attempts to modify this deficiency are critical. As demonstrated in zebrafish, recall of the embryonic developmental program may be the key to success. Because thymosin beta4 (TB4) is beneficial for myocardial cell survival and essential for coronary development in embryos, we hypothesized that it reactivates the embryonic developmental program and initiates epicardial progenitor mobilization in adult mammals. We found that TB4 stimulates capillary-like tube formation of adult coronary endothelial cells and increases embryonic endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro. The increase of blood vessel/epicardial substance (Bves) expressing cells accompanied by elevated VEGF, Flk-1, TGF-beta, Fgfr-2, Fgfr-4, Fgf-17 and beta-Catenin expression and increase of Tbx-18 and Wt-1 positive myocardial progenitors suggested organ-wide recall of the embryonic program in the adult epicardium. TB4 also positively regulated the expression and phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (Marcks), a direct substrate and indicator of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in vitro and in vivo. PKC inhibition significantly reduced TB4 initiated epicardial thickening, capillary growth and the number of myocardial progenitors. Our results demonstrate that TB4 is the first known molecule capable of organ-wide activation of the embryonic coronary developmental program in the adult mammalian heart after systemic administration and that PKC plays a significant role in the process.

27473374|t|Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in hepatic stellate cells - evidence for a role in hepatocellular carcinoma growth in vivo.
27473374|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies have established that proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) promotes migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, suggesting a role in HCC progression. Here, we assessed the impact of PAR2 in HCC stromal cells on HCC growth using LX-2 hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Hep3B cells as model. METHODS: PAR2 expression and function in LX-2 cells was analysed by RT-PCR, confocal immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and [Ca(2+)]i measurements, respectively. The impact of LX-2-expressed PAR2 on tumour growth in vivo was monitored using HCC xenotransplantation experiments in SCID mice, in which HCC-like tumours were induced by coinjection of LX-2 cells and Hep3B cells. To characterise the effects of PAR2 activation in LX-2 cells, various signalling pathways were analysed by immunoblotting and proteome profiler arrays. RESULTS: Following verification of functional PAR2 expression in LX-2 cells, in vivo studies showed that these cells promoted tumour growth and angiogenesis of HCC xenografts in mice. These effects were significantly reduced when F2RL1 (encoding PAR2) was downregulated by RNA interference (RNAi). In vitro studies confirmed these results demonstrating RNAi mediated inhibition of PAR2 attenuated Smad2/3 activation in response to TGF-b1 stimulation in LX-2 cells and blocked the pro-mitotic effect of LX-2 derived conditioned medium on Hep3B cells. Furthermore, PAR2 stimulation with trypsin or a PAR2-selective activating peptide (PAR2-AP) led to activation of different intracellular signalling pathways, an increased secretion of pro-angiogenic and pro-mitotic factors and proteinases, and an enhanced migration rate across a collagen-coated membrane barrier. Silencing F2RL1 by RNAi or pharmacological inhibition of Src, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) blocked PAR2-AP-induced migration. CONCLUSION: PAR2 in HSCs plays a crucial role in promoting HCC growth presumably by mediating migration and secretion of pro-angiogenic and pro-mitotic factors. Therefore, PAR2 in stromal HSCs may have relevance as a therapeutic target of HCC.

28414304|t|Transforming activity and therapeutic targeting of C-terminal-binding protein 2 in Apc-mutated neoplasia.
28414304|a|Overexpression of the transcriptional coregulators C-terminal binding proteins 1 and 2 (CtBP1 and 2) occurs in many human solid tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. CtBP modulates oncogenic gene expression programs and is an emerging drug target, but its oncogenic role is unclear. Consistent with this oncogenic potential, exogenous CtBP2 transformed primary mouse and human cells to anchorage independence similarly to mutant H-Ras. To investigate CtBP's contribution to in vivo tumorigenesis, Apc(min/+) mice, which succumb to massive intestinal polyposis, were bred to Ctbp2(+/-) mice. CtBP interacts with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, and is stabilized in both APC-mutated human colon cancers and Apc(min/+) intestinal polyps. Ctbp2 heterozygosity increased the median survival of Apc(min/+) mice from 21 to 48 weeks, and reduced polyp formation by 90%, with Ctbp2(+/-) polyps exhibiting reduced levels of b-catenin and its oncogenic transcriptional target, cyclin D1. CtBP's potential as a therapeutic target was studied by treating Apc(min/+) mice with the CtBP small-molecule inhibitors 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyric acid and 2-hydroxy-imino phenylpyruvic acid, both of which reduced polyposis by more than half compared with vehicle treatment. Phenocopying Ctbp2 deletion, both Ctbp inhibitors caused substantial decreases in the protein level of Ctbp2, as well its oncogenic partner b-catenin, and the effects of the inhibitors on CtBP and b-catenin levels could be modeled in an APC-mutated human colon cancer cell line. CtBP2 is thus a druggable transforming oncoprotein critical for the evolution of neoplasia driven by Apc mutation.

28416580|t|A TSPO ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.
28416580|a|Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease without effective treatment. After ICH, the immediate infiltration of leukocytes and activation of microglia are accompanied by a rapid up-regulation of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). TSPO ligands have shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in models of CNS injury. In this study, we determined the impact of a TSPO ligand, etifoxine, on brain injury and inflammation in 2 mouse models of ICH. TSPO was up-regulated in Iba1(+) cells from brains of patients with ICH and in CD11b(+)CD45(int) cells from mice subjected to collagenase-induced ICH. Etifoxine significantly reduced neurodeficits and perihematomal brain edema after ICH induction by injection of either autologous blood or collagenase. In collagenase-induced ICH mice, the protection of etifoxine was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brain and microglial production of IL-6 and TNF-a. Etifoxine improved blood-brain barrier integrity and diminished cell death. Notably, the protective effect of etifoxine was abolished in mice depleted of microglia by using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor. These results indicate that the TSPO ligand etifoxine attenuates brain injury and inflammation after ICH. TSPO may be a viable therapeutic target that requires further investigations in ICH.-Li, M., Ren, H., Sheth, K. N., Shi, F.-D., Liu, Q. A TSPO ligand attenuates brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage.

28747658|t|A single amino acid substitution confers B-cell clonogenic activity to the HIV-1 matrix protein p17.
28747658|a|Recent data highlight the presence, in HIV-1-seropositive patients with lymphoma, of p17 variants (vp17s) endowed with B-cell clonogenicity, suggesting a role of vp17s in lymphomagenesis. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for the functional disparity on B cells between a wild-type p17 (refp17) and a vp17 named S75X. Here, we show that a single Arginine (R) to Glycine (G) mutation at position 76 in the refp17 backbone (p17R76G), as in the S75X variant, is per se sufficient to confer a B-cell clonogenic potential to the viral protein and modulate, through activation of the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, different molecules involved in apoptosis inhibition (CASP-9, CASP-7, DFF-45, NPM, YWHAZ, Src, PAX2, MAPK8), cell cycle promotion and cancer progression (CDK1, CDK2, CDK8, CHEK1, CHEK2, GSK-3 beta, NPM, PAK1, PP2C-alpha). Moreover, the only R to G mutation at position 76 was found to strongly impact on protein folding and oligomerization by altering the hydrogen bond network. This generates a conformational shift in the p17 R76G mutant which enables a functional epitope(s), masked in refp17, to elicit B-cell growth-promoting signals after its interaction with a still unknown receptor(s). Our findings offer new opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms accounting for the B-cell growth-promoting activity of vp17s.

27075747|t|Anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody promotes bone fracture healing through regulating IL-20-mediated osteoblastogenesis.
27075747|a|Bone loss and skeletal fragility in bone fracture are caused by an imbalance in bone remodeling. The current challenge in bone fracture healing is to promote osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. We aimed to explore the role of IL-20 in osteoblastogenesis, osteoblast differentiation and bone fracture. Serum IL-20 was significantly correlated with serum sclerostin in patients with bone fracture. In a mouse model, anti-IL-20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7E increased bone formation during fracture healing. In vitro, IL-20 inhibited osteoblastogenesis by upregulating sclerostin, and downregulating osterix (OSX), RUNX2, and osteoprotegerin (OPG). IL-20R1 deficiency attenuated IL-20-mediated inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and maturation and reduced the healing time after a bone fracture. We conclude that IL-20 affects bone formation and downregulates osteoblastogenesis by modulating sclerostin, OSX, RUNX2, and OPG on osteoblasts. Our results demonstrated that IL-20 is involved in osteoregulation and anti-IL-20 mAb is a potential therapeutic for treating bone fracture or metabolic bone diseases.

25818835|t|An in vivo screen to identify candidate neurogenic genes in the developing Xenopus visual system.
25818835|a|Neurogenesis in the brain of Xenopus laevis continues throughout larval stages of development. We developed a 2-tier screen to identify candidate genes controlling neurogenesis in Xenopus optic tectum in vivo. First, microarray and NanoString analyses were used to identify candidate genes that were differentially expressed in Sox2-expressing neural progenitor cells or their neuronal progeny. Then an in vivo, time-lapse imaging-based screen was used to test whether morpholinos against 34 candidate genes altered neural progenitor cell proliferation or neuronal differentiation over 3 days in the optic tectum of intact Xenopus tadpoles. We co-electroporated antisense morpholino oligonucleotides against each of the candidate genes with a plasmid that drives GFP expression in Sox2-expressing neural progenitor cells and quantified the effects of morpholinos on neurogenesis. Of the 34 morpholinos tested, 24 altered neural progenitor cell proliferation or neuronal differentiation. The candidates which were tagged as differentially expressed and validated by the in vivo imaging screen include: actn1, arl9, eif3a, elk4, ephb1, fmr1-a, fxr1-1, fbxw7, fgf2, gstp1, hat1, hspa5, lsm6, mecp2, mmp9, and prkaca. Several of these candidates, including fgf2 and elk4, have known or proposed neurogenic functions, thereby validating our strategy to identify candidates. Genes with no previously demonstrated neurogenic functions, gstp1, hspa5 and lsm6, were identified from the morpholino experiments, suggesting that our screen successfully revealed unknown candidates. Genes that are associated with human disease, such as such as mecp2 and fmr1-a, were identified by our screen, providing the groundwork for using Xenopus as an experimental system to probe conserved disease mechanisms. Together the data identify candidate neurogenic regulatory genes and demonstrate that Xenopus is an effective experimental animal to identify and characterize genes that regulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in vivo.

23254194|t|Gastric expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is associated with hyperphagia and obesity in mice.
23254194|a|The adipokine plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is increased in plasma of obese individuals and exhibits increased expression in the stomachs of individuals infected with Helicobacter. To investigate the relevance of gastric PAI-1, we used 1.1 kb of the H(+)/K(+)b subunit promoter to overexpress PAI-1 specifically in mouse gastric parietal cells (PAI-1-H/Kb mice). We studied the physiological, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics of these and mice null for PAI-1 or a putative receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). PAI-1-H/Kb mice had increased plasma concentrations of PAI-1 and increased body mass, adiposity, and hyperphagia compared with wild-type mice. In the latter, food intake was inhibited by cholecystokinin (CCK)8s, but PAI-1-H/Kb mice were insensitive to the satiating effects of CCK8s. PAI-1-H/Kb mice also had significantly reduced expression of c-fos in the nucleus tractus solitarius in response to CCK8s and refeeding compared with wild-type mice. Exogenous PAI-1 reversed the effects of CCK8s on food intake and c-fos levels in the nucleus tractus solitarius of wild-type mice, but not uPAR-null mice. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with Helicobacter felis increased gastric abundance of PAI-1 and reduced the satiating effects of CCK8s, whereas the response to CCK8s was maintained in infected PAI-1-null mice. In cultured vagal afferent neurons, PAI-1 inhibited stimulation of neuropeptide Y type 2 receptor (Y2R) expression by CCK8s. Thus, gastric expression of PAI-1 is associated with hyperphagia, moderate obesity, and resistance to the satiating effects of CCK indicating a new role in suppressing signals from the upper gut that inhibit food intake.

24142921|t|Identification and characterization of FGF2-dependent mRNA: microRNA networks during lens fiber cell differentiation.
24142921|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling regulate a wide range of cellular functions, including cell specification, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival. In lens, both these systems control lens fiber cell differentiation; however, a possible link between these processes remains to be examined. Herein, the functional requirement for miRNAs in differentiating lens fiber cells was demonstrated via conditional inactivation of Dicer1 in mouse (Mus musculus) lens. To dissect the miRNA-dependent pathways during lens differentiation, we used a rat (Rattus norvegicus) lens epithelial explant system, induced by FGF2 to differentiate, followed by mRNA and miRNA expression profiling. Transcriptome and miRNome analysis identified extensive FGF2-regulated cellular responses that were both independent and dependent on miRNAs. We identified 131 FGF2-regulated miRNAs. Seventy-six of these miRNAs had at least two in silico predicted and inversely regulated target mRNAs. Genes modulated by the greatest number of FGF-regulated miRNAs include DNA-binding transcription factors Nfib, Nfat5/OREBP, c-Maf, Ets1, and N-Myc. Activated FGF signaling influenced bone morphogenetic factor/transforming growth factor-beta, Notch, and Wnt signaling cascades implicated earlier in lens differentiation. Specific miRNA:mRNA interaction networks were predicted for c-Maf, N-Myc, and Nfib (DNA-binding transcription factors); Cnot6, Cpsf6, Dicer1, and Tnrc6b (RNA to miRNA processing); and Ash1l, Med1/PBP, and Kdm5b/Jarid1b/Plu1 (chromatin remodeling). Three miRNAs, including miR-143, miR-155, and miR-301a, down-regulated expression of c-Maf in the 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assays. These present studies demonstrate for the first time global impact of activated FGF signaling in lens cell culture system and predicted novel gene regulatory networks connected by multiple miRNAs that regulate lens differentiation.

30478082|t|Conditional Inactivation of Nf1 and Pten in Schwann Cells Results in Abnormal Neuromuscular Junction Maturation.
30478082|a|The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) consists of three components, namely presynaptic motor neurons, postsynaptic muscle fibers and perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs). The role of Schwann cells (SCs) in regulating NMJ structural and functional development remains unclear. In this study, mice with conditional inactivation of neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), specifically in SCs, resulted in delayed NMJ maturation that led to delayed muscle growth, recapitulating the muscular dystrophy condition observed in human neurofibromatosis type I syndrome (NF1) patients. Expression levels of NMJ development related molecules such as cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha polypeptide 1 (Chrna1), agrin (Agrn), dystrophin, muscular dystrophy (Dmd), laminin, beta 2 (Lamb2) and dystroglycan 1 (Dag1) were also downregulated. To further explore the molecular alterations in these SCs, NF1- and PTEN-related pathways were analyzed in mutant sciatic nerves. As expected, hyperactive RAS/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways were identified, suggesting the importance of these pathways for NMJ development, and subsequent muscle maturation.

22971992|t|EGCG inhibits growth of human pancreatic tumors orthotopically implanted in Balb C nude mice through modulation of FKHRL1/FOXO3a and neuropilin.
22971992|a|Human pancreatic cancer is currently one of the fourth leading causes of cancer-related mortality with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5 %. Since pancreatic carcinoma is largely refractory to conventional therapies, there is a strong medical need for the development of novel and innovative cancer preventive strategies. The forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FOXO) play a major role in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumorigenesis. The objectives of this study were to examine whether FKHRL1/FOXO3a modulates antitumor activity of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an active ingredient in green tea, in pancreatic cancer model in vivo. PANC-1 cells were orthotopically implanted into Balb c nude mice and gavaged with EGCG after tumor formation. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by Ki67 and TUNEL staining, respectively. The expression of PI3K, AKT, ERK, and FOXO3a/FKHRL1 and its target genes were measured by the western blot analysis and/or q-RT-PCR. FOXO-DNA binding was measured by gel shift assay. EGCG-treated mice showed significant inhibition in tumor growth which was associated with reduced phosphorylation of ERK, PI3K, AKT, and FKHRL1/FOXO3a, and modulation of FOXO target genes. EGCG induced apoptosis by upregulating Bim and activating caspase-3. EGCG modulated markers of cell cycle (p27/KIP1), angiogenesis (CD31, VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, SEMA3F, and HIF1a), and metastasis (MMP2 and MMP7). The inhibition of VEGF by EGCG was associated with suppression of neuropilin. EGCG inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition by upregulating the expression of E-cadherin and inhibiting the expression of N-cadherin and Zeb1. These data suggest that EGCG inhibits pancreatic cancer orthotopic tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis which are associated with inhibition of PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways and activation of FKHRL1/FOXO3a. As a conclusion, EGCG can be used for the prevention and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer.

30372497|t|Cyp1b1 expression impacts the angiogenic and inflammatory properties of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.
30372497|a|Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is a member of the cytochrome p450 family of enzymes that catalyze mono-oxygenase reactions. Although constitutive Cyp1b1 expression is limited in hepatocytes, its expression and function in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) remains unknown. Here we determined the impact of Cyp1b1 expression on LSEC properties prepared from Cyp1b1+/+ and Cyp1b1-/- mice. LSEC expressed PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, and B4 lectin similar to EC from other mouse tissues. Cyp1b1 +/+ LSEC constitutively expressed significant levels of Cyp1b1, while Cyp1b1-/- LSEC lacked Cyp1b1 expression. LSEC also expressed VEGFR3, PROX-1, and LYVE-1, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, as well as other cell adhesion molecules including ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) receptors, CD36 and CD47. However, the expression of PV-1 and stabilin (fenestration markers), and endoglin were limited in these cells. The Cyp1b1-/- LSEC showed limited fenestration, and decreased levels of VEGF and BMP6. Cyp1b1-/- LSEC also showed a decrease in the levels of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 impacting adherens and gap junction formation. Cyp1b1-/- LSEC were significantly more apoptotic, proliferated at a faster rate, and were less adherent and more migratory. These changes were attributed, in part, to decreased amounts of TSP1 and increased AKT and ERK activation. The expressions of integrins were also altered by the lack of Cyp1b1, but the ability of these cells to undergo capillary morphogenesis was minimally affected. Furthermore, Cyp1b1-/- LSEC expressed lower levels of inflammatory mediators MCP-1 and TNF-alpha. Thus, Cyp1b1 expression has a significant impact on LSEC angiogenic and inflammatory functions.

27491646|t|Gartanin induces cell cycle arrest and autophagy and suppresses migration involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signalling pathway in human glioma cells.
27491646|a|In central nervous system, glioma is the most common primary brain tumour. The diffuse migration and rapid proliferation are main obstacles for successful treatment. Gartanin, a natural xanthone of mangosteen, suppressed proliferation, migration and colony formation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in T98G glioma cells but not in mouse normal neuronal HT22 cells. Gartanin, at low micromole, led to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase accompanied by inhibited expression level of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, while increased expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. In addition, the secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 (MMP-2/-9) were significantly suppressed in T98G cells treated with gartanin, and it might result from modulating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathway in T98G glioma cells. Moreover, gartanin significantly induced autophagy in T98G cells and increased GFP-LC3 punctate fluorescence accompanied by the increased expression level of Beclin 1 and LC3-II, while suppressed expression level of p62. Gartanin treatment resulted in obvious inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, which is important in modulating autophagy. Notably, gartanin-mediated anti-viability was significantly abrogated by autophagy inhibitors including 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ). These results indicate that anti-proliferation effect of gartanin in T98G cells is most likely via cell cycle arrest modulated by autophagy, which is regulated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, while anti-migration effect is most likely via suppression of MMP-2/-9 activity which is involved in MAPK signalling pathway.

25849622|t|Regulation of IL-17A responses in human airway smooth muscle cells by Oncostatin M.
25849622|a|BACKGROUND: Regulation of human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMC) by cytokines contributes to chemotactic factor levels and thus to inflammatory cell accumulation in lung diseases. Cytokines such as the gp130 family member Oncostatin M (OSM) can act synergistically with Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) to modulate lung cells, however whether IL-17A responses by HASMC can be altered is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of recombinant OSM, or other gp130 cytokines (LIF, IL-31, and IL-6) in regulating HASMC responses to IL-17A, assessing MCP-1/CCL2 and IL-6 expression and cell signaling pathways. METHODS: Cell responses of primary HASMC cultures were measured by the assessment of protein levels in supernatants (ELISA) and mRNA levels (qRT-PCR) in cell extracts. Activation of STAT, MAPK (p38) and Akt pathways were measured by immunoblot. Pharmacological agents were used to assess the effects of inhibition of these pathways. RESULTS: OSM but not LIF, IL-31 or IL-6 could induce detectable responses in HASMC, elevating MCP-1/CCL2, IL-6 levels and activation of STAT-1, 3, 5, p38 and Akt cell signaling pathways. OSM induced synergistic action with IL-17A enhancing MCP-1/CCL-2 and IL-6 mRNA and protein expression, but not eotaxin-1 expression, while OSM in combination with IL-4 or IL-13 synergistically induced eotaxin-1 and MCP-1/CCL2. OSM elevated steady state mRNA levels of IL-4Ra, OSMRb and gp130, but not IL-17RA or IL-17RC. Pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3 activation using Stattic down-regulated OSM, OSM/IL-4 or OSM/IL-13, and OSM/IL-17A synergistic responses of MCP-1/CCL-2 induction, whereas, inhibitors of Akt and p38 MAPK resulted in less reduction in MCP-1/CCL2 levels. IL-6 expression was more sensitive to inhibition of p38 (using SB203580) and was affected by Stattic in response to IL-17A/OSM stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Oncostatin M can regulate HASMC responses alone or in synergy with IL-17A. OSM/IL-17A combinations enhance MCP-1/CCL2 and IL-6 but not eotaxin-1. Thus, OSM through STAT3 activation of HASMC may participate in inflammatory cell recruitment in inflammatory airway disease.

In this study, we tested whether an orally available 5-OH-tryptamine (5HT) 1a receptor agonist, xaliproden, could protect against retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell damage in culture and in a mouse model of geographic atrophy. METHODS: Paraquat was used to create mitochondrial oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) was used to stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines in these cells. The production of antioxidant proteins, metallothionein, and inflammatory cytokines was assayed with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell survival was analyzed with microscopy and a cell titer assay. Integrity of the RPE monolayer was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and with immunocytochemistry with zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) antibody. RPE atrophy was studied in mice deleted for Sod2 (the gene for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase) specifically in the RPE. The mice were treated orally with daily doses of xaliproden at 0.5 and 3 mg/kg for 4 months. The retinal structure was analyzed with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and with light and electron microscopy. Retinal function was assessed with full-field electroretinography (ERG) and with optokinetic measurements. RESULTS: Xaliproden led to a dose-dependent increase in cell survival following treatment with paraquat. Synthesis of the antioxidant response genes NqO1, GSTM1, CAT, HO-1, and Nrf2 was increased in response to the drug, as was the zinc chaperone metallothionein. Treatment of cells with TNF-a led to increased production of IL-1b, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by ARPE-19 cells, and this response was attenuated by treatment with xaliproden. TNF-a also led to a decrease in the TEER that was prevented by treatment with the 5HT1a agonist. Daily gavage with xaliproden at either dose induced the production of protective enzymes in the mouse retina, and treatment of the Sod2-deleted mice with the drug showed improved thickness of the outer nuclear layer and improved visual acuity relative to the control-treated mice. There was no significant difference in full-field scotopic ERG among the treatment groups, however. Vacuolization of the RPE and disorganization of the photoreceptor outer segments were reduced at both dose levels of xaliproden. CONCLUSIONS: Xaliproden protected RPE cells from oxidative and inflammatory insults and protected the mouse RPE and retina from RPE atrophy in the face of excess mitochondrial oxidative stress. These results suggest that this drug, which had a reasonable safety profile in clinical trials, may be used to prevent the progression of geographic atrophy in humans.

27626488|t|TGF-b1 promotes colorectal cancer immune escape by elevating B7-H3 and B7-H4 via the miR-155/miR-143 axis.
27626488|a|Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1) suppresses T cell function, promoting tumor immune escape. Yet, whether the depression of TGF-b1 on T cell function is mediated by co-inhibitory molecules B7-H3 and B7-H4 remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that TGF-b1 elevated the expression of miR-155 in colorectal cancer cells through SMAD3 and SMAD4. The upregulated miR-155 attenuated miR-143 by inhibiting its direct target, the transcription factor CEBPB. Consequently, the direct target genes of miR-143, B7-H3 and B7-H4, were augmented in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells. Over-expression of B7-H3 and B7-H4 in HCT-116 cells induced T cells to secrete TGF-b1 and the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17. Restoration of miR-143 inhibited the growth of HCT-116 xenograft tumors in mice, and also repressed the expression of B7-H3 and B7-H4 in the tumors. Thus, this study reveals the mechanism by which TGF-b1 leads to T cell-mediated tumor evasion through an increase in B7-H3 and B7-H4 expression.

29045486|t|Thiamine deficiency activates hypoxia inducible factor-1a to facilitate pro-apoptotic responses in mouse primary astrocytes.
29045486|a|Thiamine is an essential enzyme cofactor required for proper metabolic function and maintenance of metabolism and energy production in the brain. In developed countries, thiamine deficiency (TD) is most often manifested following chronic alcohol consumption leading to impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation and excitotoxicity. These biochemical lesions result in apoptotic cell death in both neurons and astrocytes. Comparable histological injuries in patients with hypoxia/ischemia and TD have been described in the thalamus and mammillary bodies, suggesting a congruency between the cellular responses to these stresses. Consistent with hypoxia/ischemia, TD stabilizes and activates Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1a (HIF-1a) under physiological oxygen levels. However, the role of TD-induced HIF-1a in neurological injury is currently unknown. Using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, we have demonstrated that TD induces HIF-1a expression and activity in primary mouse astrocytes. We observed a time-dependent increase in mRNA and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory HIF-1a target genes MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa during TD. We also observed apoptotic cell death in TD as demonstrated by PI/Annexin V staining, TUNEL assay, and Cell Death ELISA. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1a activity using YC1 and thiamine repletion both reduced expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1a target genes and apoptotic cell death in TD. These results demonstrate that induction of HIF-1a mediated transcriptional up-regulation of pro-apoptotic/inflammatory signaling contributes to astrocyte cell death during thiamine deficiency.

29059224|t|Netrin-1 is a novel regulator of vascular endothelial function in diabetes.
29059224|a|BACKGROUND: Netrin-1, a secreted laminin-like protein identified as an axon guidance molecule, has been shown to be of critical importance in the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties of netrin-1 as well as cardioprotective actions against myocardial injury in diabetic mice. AIM: To examine the role of netrin-1 in diabetes-and high glucose (HG)-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) using netrin-1 transgenic mice (Tg3) and cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). MAIN OUTCOME: Overexpression of netrin-1 prevented diabetes-induced VED in aorta from diabetic mice and netrin-1 treatment attenuated HG-induced impairment of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) function in BAECs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were performed in Tg3 and littermate control (WT) mice rendered diabetic with streptozotocin (STZ) and in BAECs treated with HG (25 mmol/L). Levels of netrin-1 and its receptor DCC, markers of inflammation and apoptosis and vascular function were assessed in aortas from diabetic and non-diabetic Tg3 and WT mice. Vascular netrin-1 in WT mice was reduced under diabetic conditions. Aortas from non-diabetic Tg3 and WT mice showed similar maximum endothelium-dependent relaxation (MEDR) (83% and 87%, respectively). MEDR was markedly impaired in aorta from diabetic WT mice (51%). This effect was significantly blunted in Tg3 diabetic aortas (70%). Improved vascular relaxation in Tg3 diabetic mice was associated with increased levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and reduced levels of oxidant stress, NFkB, COX-2, p16INK4A, cleaved caspase-3 and p16 and p53 mRNA. Netrin-1 treatment prevented the HG-induced decrease in NO production and elevation of oxidative stress and apoptosis in BAECs. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes decreases aortic levels of netrin-1. However, overexpression of netrin-1 attenuates diabetes-induced VED and limits the reduction of NO levels, while increasing expression of p-ERK1/2, and suppressing oxidative stress and inflammatory and apoptotic processes. Enhancement of netrin-1 function may be a useful therapeutic means for preventing vascular dysfunction in diabetes.

19741124|t|The tetraspanin KAI1/CD82 is expressed by late-lineage oligodendrocyte precursors and may function to restrict precursor migration and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.
19741124|a|In the adult mammalian brain, oligodendrocyte progenitors can differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes during remyelination. Mechanisms that regulate migration and differentiation of progenitors are of great importance in understanding normal development and demyelinating/remyelinating conditions. In a microarray analysis comparing adult and neonatal O4-positive (+) cells, we found that the tetraspanin KAI1/CD82 is far more highly expressed in adult O4(+) cells than in neonatal O4(+) cells (Lin et al., 2009). CD82 is a metastasis suppressor, and its expression is often downregulated or lost in the advanced stages of metastatic cancer. We hypothesized that CD82 could be a factor that restricts migration and promotes differentiation of maturing oligodendrocytes. Western blot analysis of isolated adult O4(+) cells confirms the elevated levels of CD82, which continues to be expressed as these become O1(+) in vitro. In the adult rat white matter, CD82 is coexpressed with CC1 and olig2 but not with NG2 or GFAP. Immature cells of the neonatal forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) infected in vivo with a retrovirus that constitutively expresses CD82 do not remain immature but differentiate into either CC1(+) and MBP(+) myelinating oligodendrocytes in the white matter or zebrinII(+) astrocytes in the cortex. Their migration from the SVZ is severely restricted. In contrast, downregulation of CD82 in SVZ cells in vivo, using retroviral-expressed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), prevents their differentiation into myelinating oligodendrocytes. shRNA-expressing cells remained PDGF receptor alpha positive, olig2(+), or NG2(+) or became CC1(+) nonmyelinating oligodendrocytes or GFAP(+) astrocytes. CD82 thus appears to be a critical molecule in the regulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor migration and myelination.

27288531|t|Loss of the Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase PTPN22 Reduces Mannan-Induced Autoimmune Arthritis in SKG Mice.
27288531|a|The cytoplasmic phosphatase, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22), is a negative regulator of T cell signaling. Genome-wide association studies have shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PTPN22 confer an increased risk of developing multiple autoimmune diseases in humans. The precise function of PTPN22 and how the variant protein contributes to autoimmunity is not well understood. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of PTPN22 deficiency on disease susceptibility in a mouse model of autoimmune arthritis. The SKG mouse expresses a hypomorphic mutant allele of ZAP70, which, upon exposure to fungal Ags, predisposes the mice to a CD4(+) T cell-mediated autoimmune arthritis that closely resembles rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Surprisingly, SKG Ptpn22(-/-) mice developed less severe mannan-induced arthritis compared with SKG mice. Diminution of disease was not due to significant alterations in thymocyte development or repertoire selection in SKG Ptpn22(-/-) mice, even though T cell-mediated signal transduction was improved. Instead, Ptpn22 deficiency appeared to bias CD4 Th cell differentiation away from the Th17 lineage, which is pathogenic in this setting, to a more Th1/T regulatory-focused response. These data show that even small perturbations in TCR signal transduction pathways can have profound consequences on the differentiation of T cell lineages and thus for the development of autoimmune diseases.

27999109|t|A Critical Role for the Type I Interferon Receptor in Virus-Induced Autoimmune Diabetes in Rats.
27999109|a|The pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes, characterized by immune-mediated damage of insulin-producing b-cells of pancreatic islets, may involve viral infection. Essential components of the innate immune antiviral response, including type I interferon (IFN) and IFN receptor-mediated signaling pathways, are candidates for determining susceptibility to human type 1 diabetes. Numerous aspects of human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis are recapitulated in the LEW.1WR1 rat model. Diabetes can be induced in LEW.1WR1 weanling rats challenged with virus or with the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). We hypothesized that disrupting the cognate type I IFN receptor (type I IFN a/b receptor [IFNAR]) to interrupt IFN signaling would prevent or delay the development of virus-induced diabetes. We generated IFNAR1 subunit-deficient LEW.1WR1 rats using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) genome editing and confirmed functional disruption of the Ifnar1 gene. IFNAR1 deficiency significantly delayed the onset and frequency of diabetes and greatly reduced the intensity of insulitis after poly I:C treatment. The occurrence of Kilham rat virus-induced diabetes was also diminished in IFNAR1-deficient animals. These findings firmly establish that alterations in innate immunity influence the course of autoimmune diabetes and support the use of targeted strategies to limit or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes.

28701508|t|Prdm1 Regulates Thymic Epithelial Function To Prevent Autoimmunity.
28701508|a|Autoimmunity is largely prevented by medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs) through their expression and presentation of tissue-specific Ags to developing thymocytes, resulting in deletion of self-reactive T cells and supporting regulatory T cell development. The transcription factor Prdm1 has been implicated in autoimmune diseases in humans through genome-wide association studies and in mice using cell type-specific deletion of Prdm1 in T and dendritic cells. In this article, we demonstrate that Prdm1 functions in TECs to prevent autoimmunity in mice. Prdm1 is expressed by a subset of mouse TECs, and conditional deletion of Prdm1 in either Keratin 14- or Foxn1-expressing cells in mice resulted in multisymptom autoimmune pathology. Notably, the development of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells occurs normally in the absence of Blimp1. Importantly, nude mice developed anti-nuclear Abs when transplanted with Prdm1 null TECs, but not wild-type TECs, indicating that Prdm1 functions in TECs to regulate autoantibody production. We show that Prdm1 acts independently of Aire, a crucial transcription factor implicated in medullary TEC function. Collectively, our data highlight a previously unrecognized role for Prdm1 in regulating thymic epithelial function.

28359799|t|Paxillin and embryonic PolyAdenylation Binding Protein (ePABP) engage to regulate androgen-dependent Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation - A model of kinase-dependent regulation of protein expression.
28359799|a|Steroid-triggered Xenopus laevis oocyte maturation is an elegant physiologic model of nongenomic steroid signaling, as it proceeds completely independent of transcription. We previously demonstrated that androgens are the main physiologic stimulator of oocyte maturation in Xenopus oocytes, and that the adaptor protein paxillin plays a crucial role in mediating this process through a positive feedback loop in which paxillin first enhances Mos protein translation, ensued by Erk2 activation and Erk-dependent phosphorylation of paxillin on serine residues. Phosphoserine-paxillin then further augments Mos protein translation and downstream Erk2 activation, resulting in meiotic progression. We hypothesized that paxillin enhances Mos translation by interacting with embryonic PolyAdenylation Binding Protein (ePABP) on polyadenylated Mos mRNA. Knockdown of ePABP phenocopied paxillin knockdown, with reduced Mos protein expression, Erk2 and Cdk1 activation, as well as oocyte maturation. In both Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells (HEK-293), paxillin and ePABP constitutively interacted. Testosterone (Xenopus) or EGF (HEK-293) augmented ePABP-paxillin binding, as well as ePABP binding to Mos mRNA (Xenopus), in an Erk-dependent fashion. Thus, ePABP and paxillin work together in an Erk-dependent fashion to enhance Mos protein translation and promote oocyte maturation.

24623966|t|Endothelial NADPH oxidase 4 mediates vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-induced intravitreal neovascularization in a rat model of retinopathy of prematurity.
24623966|a|PURPOSE: NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in angiogenesis. Isoforms of NADPH oxidase NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (ECs). Of these, NOX1 and NOX2 have been reported to contribute to intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the isoform NOX4 in ECs contributed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis and IVNV. METHODS: Isoforms of NADPH oxidase MRNA were measured in several types of cultured vascular ecs: human retinal microvascular ECs (hRMVECs), choroidal ECs (CECs), and human umbilical vascular ECs (HUVECs) using real-time PCR. Newborn rat pups and dams were placed into an OIR model that cycled oxygen concentration between 50% and 10% every 24 h for 14 days, and then were placed in room air (RA) for an additional 4 days (rat OIR model). NOX4 expression in retinal lysates from the RA-raised pups at postnatal day 0 (P0), P14, and P18 was determined with western blots. STAT3 activation was determined as the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 to total STAT3 with western blot analysis of retinal lysates from pups raised in RA or from the rat OIR model at P18. Semiquantitative assessment of the density of NOX4 colabeling with lectin-stained retinal ECs was determined by immunolabeling of retinal cryosections from P18 pups in OIR or in RA. In hRMVECs transfected with NOX4 siRNA and treated with VEGF or control, 1) ROS generation was measured using the 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester fluorescence assay and 2) phosphorylated VEGF receptor 2 and STAT3, and total VEGFR2 and STAT3 were measured in western blot analyses. VEGF-stimulated hRMVEC proliferation was measured following transfection with NOX4 siRNA or STAT3 siRNA, or respective controls. RESULTS: NOX4 was the most prevalent isoform of NADPH oxidase in vascular ECs. NOX4 expression in retinal lysates was significantly decreased during development in RA. Compared to RA, the expression of retinal NOX4 increased at P18. At p18 OIR, semiquantitative assessment of the density of lectin and NOX4 colabeling in retinal vascular ECs was greater in retinal cryosections and activated STAT3 was greater in retinal lysates when compared to the RA-raised pups. In cultured hRMVECs, knockdown of NOX4 by siRNA transfection inhibited VEGF-induced ROS generation. VEGF induced a physical interaction of phosphorylated-VEGFR2 and NOX4. Knockdown of NOX4: 1) reduced VEGFR2 activation but did not abolish it and 2) abolished STAT3 activation in response to VEGF. Knockdown of either NOX4 or STAT3 inhibited VEGF-induced EC proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in a model representative of human retinopathy of prematurity, NOX4 was increased at a time point when IVNV developed. VEGF-activated NOX4 led to an interaction between VEGF-activated VEGFR2 and NOX4 that mediated EC proliferation via activation of STAT3. Altogether, our results suggest that NOX4 may regulate VEGFR2-mediated IVNV through activated STAT3.

26131711|t|Two Distinct Cdc2 Pools Regulate Cell Cycle Progression and the DNA Damage Response in the Fission Yeast S.pombe.
26131711|a|The activity of Cdc2 (CDK1) kinase, which coordinates cell cycle progression and DNA break repair, is blocked upon its phosphorylation at tyrosine 15 (Y15) by Wee1 kinase in the presence of DNA damage. How Cdc2 can support DNA repair whilst being inactivated by the DNA damage checkpoint remains to be explained. Human CDK1 is phosphorylated by Myt1 kinase at threonine 14 (T14) close to its ATP binding site before being modified at threonine 161 (T167Sp) in its T-loop by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). While modification of T161 promotes association with the cyclin partner, phosphorylation of T14 inhibits the CDK1-cyclin complex. This inhibition is further enforced by the modification of Y15 by Wee1 in the presence of DNA lesions. In S.pombe, the dominant inhibition of Cdc2 is provided by the phosphorylation of Y15 and only a small amount of Cdc2 is modified at T14 when cells are in S phase. Unlike human cells, both inhibitory modifications are executed by Wee1. Using the novel IEFPT technology, which combines isoelectric focusing (IEF) with Phos-tag SDS electrophoresis (PT), we report here that S.pombe Cdc2 kinase exists in seven forms. While five forms are phosphorylated, two species are not. Four phospho-forms associate with cyclin B (Cdc13) of which only two are modified at Y15 by Wee1. Interestingly, only one Y15-modified species carries also the T14 modification. The fifth phospho-form has a low affinity for cyclin B and is neither Y15 nor T14 modified. The two unphosphorylated forms may contribute directly to the DNA damage response as only they associate with the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk1. Interestingly, cyclin B is also present in the unphosphorylated pool. We also show that the G146D mutation in Cdc2.1w, which renders Cdc2 insensitive to Wee1 inhibition, is aberrantly modified in a Wee1-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work adds support to the idea that two distinct Cdc2 pools regulate cell cycle progression and the response to DNA damage.

28296029|t|CD38 promotes angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
28296029|a|Cardiac hypertrophy is an early hallmark during the clinical course of heart failure and regulated by various signalling pathways. Recently, we observed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts from CD38 knockout mice were significantly resistant to oxidative stress such as H2 O2 -induced injury and hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury. In addition, we also found that CD38 knockout mice protected heart from ischaemia reperfusion injury through activating SIRT1/FOXOs-mediated antioxidative stress pathway. However, the role of CD38 in cardiac hypertrophy is not explored. Here, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of CD38 in angiotensin II (Ang-II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Following 14 days of Ang-II infusion with osmotic mini-pumps, a comparable hypertension was generated in both of CD38 knockout and wild-type mice. However, the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were much more severe in wild-type mice compared with CD38 knockout mice. Consistently, RNAi-induced knockdown of CD38 decreased the gene expressions of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and reactive oxygen species generation in Ang-II-stimulated H9c2 cells. In addition, the expression of SIRT3 was elevated in CD38 knockdown H9c2 cells, in which SIRT3 may further activate the FOXO3 antioxidant pathway. The intracellular Ca(2+) release induced by Ang-II markedly decreased in CD38 knockdown H9c2 cells, which might be associated with the decrease of nuclear translocation of NFATc4 and inhibition of ERK/AKT phosphorylation. We concluded that CD38 plays an essential role in cardiac hypertrophy probably via inhibition of SIRT3 expression and activation of Ca(2+) -NFAT signalling pathway. Thus, CD38 may be a novel target for treating cardiac hypertrophy.

27517319|t|DDA suppresses angiogenesis and tumor growth of colorectal cancer in vivo through decreasing VEGFR2 signaling.
27517319|a|As angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and metastasis, suppressing angiogenesis is a promising strategy in limiting tumor progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a critical pro-angiogenic factor, has thus become an attractive target for therapeutic interventions in cancer. In this study, we explored the underlying mechanisms of a novel anthraquinone derivative DDA in suppressing angiogenesis. DDA inhibited VEGF-A-induced proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). DDA also reduced VEGF-A-induced microvessel sprouting from aortic rings ex vivo and suppressed neovascularization in vivo. VEGF-A-induced VEGFR1, VEGFR2, FAK, Akt, ERK1/2 or STAT3 phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of DDA. In addition, NRP-1 siRNA reduced VEGF-A's enhancing effects in VEGFR2, FAK and Akt phosphorylation and cell proliferation in HUVECs. DDA disrupted VEGF-A-induced complex formation between NRP-1 and VEGFR2. Furthermore, systemic administration of DDA was shown to suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth in in vivo mouse xenograft models. Taken together, we demonstrated in this study that DDA exhibits anti-angiogenic properties through suppressing VEGF-A signaling. These observations also suggest that DDA might be a potential drug candidate for developing anti-angiogenic agent in the field of cancer and angiogenesis-related diseases.

30462722|t|MicroRNA-451a overexpression induces accelerated neuronal differentiation of Ntera2/D1 cells and ablation affects neurogenesis in microRNA-451a-/- mice.
30462722|a|MiR-451a is best known for its role in erythropoiesis and for its tumour suppressor features. Here we show a role for miR-451a in neuronal differentiation through analysis of endogenous and ectopically expressed or silenced miR-451a in Ntera2/D1 cells during neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we compared neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus of miR-451a-/- and wild type mice. MiR-451a overexpression in lentiviral transduced Ntera2/D1 cells was associated with a significant shifting of mRNA expression of the developmental markers Nestin, betaIII Tubulin, NF200, DCX and MAP2 to earlier developmental time points, compared to control vector transduced cells. In line with this, accelerated neuronal network formation in AB.G.miR-451a transduced cells, as well as an increase in neurite outgrowth both in number and length was observed. MiR-451a targets genes MIF, AKT1, CAB39, YWHAZ, RAB14, TSC1, OSR1, POU3F2, TNS4, PSMB8, CXCL16, CDKN2D and IL6R were, moreover, either constantly downregulated or exhibited shifted expression profiles in AB.G.miR-451a transduced cells. Lentiviral knockdown of endogenous miR-451a expression in Ntera2/D1 cells resulted in decelerated differentiation. Endogenous miR-451a expression was upregulated during development in the hippocampus of wildtype mice. In situ hybridization revealed intensively stained single cells in the subgranular zone and the hilus of the dentate gyrus of wild type mice, while genetic ablation of miR-451a was observed to promote an imbalance between proliferation and neuronal differentiation in neurogenic brain regions, suggested by Ki67 and DCX staining. Taken together, these results provide strong support for a role of miR-451a in neuronal maturation processes in vitro and in vivo.

24014394|t|A homozygous mutation in LYRM7/MZM1L associated with early onset encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and severe reduction of mitochondrial complex III activity.
24014394|a|Mutations in nuclear genes associated with defective complex III (cIII) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are rare, having been found in only two cIII assembly factors and, as private changes in single families, three cIII structural subunits. Recently, human LYRM7/MZM1L, the ortholog of yeast MZM1, has been identified as a new assembly factor for cIII. In a baby patient with early onset, severe encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and profound, isolated cIII deficiency in skeletal muscle, we identified a disease-segregating homozygous mutation (c.73G>A) in LYRM7/MZM1L, predicting a drastic change in a highly conserved amino-acid residue (p.Asp25Asn). In a mzm1D yeast strain, the expression of a mzm1(D25N) mutant allele caused temperature-sensitive respiratory growth defect, decreased oxygen consumption, impaired maturation/stabilization of the Rieske Fe-S protein, and reduced complex III activity and amount. LYRM7/MZM1L is a novel disease gene, causing cIII-defective, early onset, severe mitochondrial encephalopathy.

25279796|t|Impaired musculoskeletal response to age and exercise in PPARb(-/-) diabetic mice.
25279796|a|Fragility fractures are recognized complication of diabetes, but yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This is particularly pronounced in type 2 diabetes in which the propensity to fall is increased but bone mass is not necessarily low. Thus, whether factors implicated in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes directly impact on the musculoskeletal system remains to be investigated. PPARb(-/-) mice have reduced metabolic activity and are glucose intolerant. We examined changes in bone and muscle in PPARb(-/-) mice and investigated both the mechanism behind those changes with age as well as their response to exercise. Compared with their wild type, PPARb(-/-) mice had an accelerated and parallel decline in both muscle and bone strength with age. These changes were accompanied by increased myostatin expression, low bone formation, and increased resorption. In addition, mesenchymal cells from PPARb(-/-) had a reduced proliferation capacity and appeared to differentiate into more of an adipogenic phenotype. Concomitantly we observed an increased expression of PPARg, characteristic of adipocytes. The anabolic responses of muscle and bone to exercise were also diminished in PPARb(-/-) mice. The periosteal bone formation response to direct bone compression was, however, maintained, indicating that PPARb controls periosteal bone formation through muscle contraction and/or metabolism. Taken together, these data indicate that PPARb deficiency leads to glucose intolerance, decreased muscle function, and reduced bone strength. On a molecular level, PPARb appears to regulate myostatin and PPARg expression in muscle and bone, thereby providing potential new targets to reverse bone fragility in patients with metabolic disturbances.

27177927|t|Calreticulin-mutant proteins induce megakaryocytic signaling to transform hematopoietic cells and undergo accelerated degradation and Golgi-mediated secretion.
27177927|a|BACKGROUND: Somatic calreticulin (CALR), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) mutations essentially show mutual exclusion in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), suggesting that they activate common oncogenic pathways. Recent data have shown that MPL function is essential for CALR mutant-driven MPN. However, the exact role and the mechanisms of action of CALR mutants have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: The murine myeloid cell line 32D and human HL60 cells overexpressing the most frequent CALR type 1 and type 2 frameshift mutants were generated to analyze the first steps of cellular transformation, in the presence and absence of MPL expression. Furthermore, mutant CALR protein stability and secretion were examined using brefeldin A, MG132, spautin-1, and tunicamycin treatment. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates that the expression of endogenous Mpl, CD41, and the key megakaryocytic transcription factor NF-E2 is stimulated by type 1 and type 2 CALR mutants, even in the absence of exogenous MPL. Mutant CALR expressing 32D cells spontaneously acquired cytokine independence, and this was associated with increased Mpl mRNA expression, CD41, and NF-E2 protein as well as constitutive activation of downstream signaling and response to JAK inhibitor treatment. Exogenous expression of MPL led to constitutive activation of STAT3 and 5, ERK1/2, and AKT, cytokine-independent growth, and reduction of apoptosis similar to the effects seen in the spontaneously outgrown cells. We observed low CALR-mutant protein amounts in cellular lysates of stably transduced cells, and this was due to accelerated protein degradation that occurred independently from the ubiquitin-proteasome system as well as autophagy. CALR-mutant degradation was attenuated by MPL expression. Interestingly, we found high levels of mutated CALR and loss of downstream signaling after blockage of the secretory pathway and protein glycosylation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potency of CALR mutants to drive expression of megakaryocytic differentiation markers such as NF-E2 and CD41 as well as Mpl. Furthermore, CALR mutants undergo accelerated protein degradation that involves the secretory pathway and/or protein glycosylation.

27014915|t|NF-kB functions as a molecular link between tumor cells and Th1/Tc1 T cells in the tumor microenvironment to exert radiation-mediated tumor suppression.
27014915|a|Radiation modulates both tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to exert its anti-tumor activity; however, the molecular connection between tumor cells and immune cells that mediates radiation-exerted tumor suppression activity in the tumor microenvironment is largely unknown. We report here that radiation induces rapid activation of the p65/p50 and p50/p50 NF-kB complexes in human soft tissue sarcoma (STS) cells. Radiation-activated p65/p50 and p50/p50 bind to the TNFa promoter to activate its transcription in STS cells. Radiation-induced TNFa induces tumor cell death in an autocrine manner. A sublethal dose of Smac mimetic BV6 induces cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation to increase tumor cell sensitivity to radiation-induced cell death in vitro and to enhance radiation-mediated suppression of STS xenografts in vivo. Inhibition of caspases, RIP1, or RIP3 blocks radiation/TNFa-induced cell death, whereas inhibition of RIP1 blocks TNFa-induced caspase activation, suggesting that caspases and RIP1 act sequentially to mediate the non-compensatory cell death pathways. Furthermore, we determined in a syngeneic sarcoma mouse model that radiation up-regulates IRF3, IFNb, and the T cell chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 in the tumor microenvironment, which are associated with activation and increased infiltration of Th1/Tc1 T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, tumor-infiltrating T cells are in their active form since both the perforin and FasL pathways are activated in irradiated tumor tissues. Consequently, combined BV6 and radiation completely suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, radiation-induced NF-kB functions as a molecular link between tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment for radiation-mediated tumor suppression.

28687665|t|Mutation of the a-tubulin Tuba1a leads to straighter microtubules and perturbs neuronal migration.
28687665|a|Brain development involves extensive migration of neurons. Microtubules (MTs) are key cellular effectors of neuronal displacement that are assembled from a/b-tubulin heterodimers. Mutation of the a-tubulin isotype TUBA1A is associated with cortical malformations in humans. In this study, we provide detailed in vivo and in vitro analyses of Tuba1a mutants. In mice carrying a Tuba1a missense mutation (S140G), neurons accumulate, and glial cells are dispersed along the rostral migratory stream in postnatal and adult brains. Live imaging of Tuba1a-mutant neurons revealed slowed migration and increased neuronal branching, which correlated with directionality alterations and perturbed nucleus-centrosome (N-C) coupling. Tuba1a mutation led to increased straightness of newly polymerized MTs, and structural modeling data suggest a conformational change in the a/b-tubulin heterodimer. We show that Tuba8, another a-tubulin isotype previously associated with cortical malformations, has altered function compared with Tuba1a. Our work shows that Tuba1a plays an essential, noncompensated role in neuronal saltatory migration in vivo and highlights the importance of MT flexibility in N-C coupling and neuronal-branching regulation during neuronal migration.

27516442|t|IGFBP1 increases b-cell regeneration by promoting a- to b-cell transdifferentiation.
27516442|a|There is great interest in therapeutically harnessing endogenous regenerative mechanisms to increase the number of b cells in people with diabetes. By performing whole-genome expression profiling of zebrafish islets, we identified 11 secreted proteins that are upregulated during b-cell regeneration. We then tested the proteins' ability to potentiate b-cell regeneration in zebrafish at supraphysiological levels. One protein, insulin-like growth factor (Igf) binding-protein 1 (Igfbp1), potently promoted b-cell regeneration by potentiating a- to b-cell transdifferentiation. Using various inhibitors and activators of the Igf pathway, we show that Igfbp1 exerts its regenerative effect, at least partly, by inhibiting Igf signaling. Igfbp1's effect on transdifferentiation appears conserved across species: Treating mouse and human islets with recombinant IGFBP1 in vitro increased the number of cells co-expressing insulin and glucagon threefold. Moreover, a prospective human study showed that having high IGFBP1 levels reduces the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by more than 85%. Thus, we identify IGFBP1 as an endogenous promoter of b-cell regeneration and highlight its clinical importance in diabetes.

28260077|t|Atorvastatin protects against contrast-induced nephropathy via anti-apoptosis by the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.
28260077|a|Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an iatrogenic acute renal failure occurring following the intravascular injection of iodinated radiographic contrast medium. However, the regulatory mechanisms for CIN remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate whether atorvastatin protects against CIN via anti-apoptotic effects by the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro. To determine whether atorvastatin attenuated CIN, the inflammatory response and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, a rat model of iopamidol-induced CIN was used, and human embryonic proximal tubule (HK2) cell damage was assessed. The rats were assigned into four groups (n=10 per group), as follows: Control rats; rats+atorvastatin; rats + iopamidol; rats+iopamidol+atorvastatin. In vitro, the HK2 cells were treated with iopamidol in the presence or absence of atorvastatin, heat shock protein (Hsp)27 small interfering (si)RNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27. The renal tissues were examined histopathologically and collected for western blot analysis. The results showed that atorvastatin ameliorated the apoptosis and deterioration of renal function (P<0.05). Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the iopamidol-induced activity of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax)/caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in vivo and in vitro. Notably, following treatment with Hsp27 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-Hsp27, it was found that iopamidol enhanced or weakened the upregulation of Bax/caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 in the HK2 cells, respectively. The results of the present study suggested that atorvastatin protected against contrast-induced renal tubular cell apoptosis through the upregulation of Hsp27 in vivo and in vitro.

18593936|t|Curcumin decreases specificity protein expression in bladder cancer cells.
18593936|a|Curcumin is the active component of tumeric, and this polyphenolic compound has been extensively investigated as an anticancer drug that modulates multiple pathways and genes. In this study, 10 to 25 micromol/L curcumin inhibited 253JB-V and KU7 bladder cancer cell growth, and this was accompanied by induction of apoptosis and decreased expression of the proapoptotic protein survivin and the angiogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). Because expression of survivin, VEGF, and VEGFR1 are dependent on specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors, we also investigated the effects of curcumin on Sp protein expression as an underlying mechanism for the apoptotic and antiangiogenic activity of this compound. The results show that curcumin induced proteasome-dependent down-regulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 in 253JB-V and KU7 cells. Moreover, using RNA interference with small inhibitory RNAs for Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, we observed that curcumin-dependent inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent genes, such as bcl-2, survivin, and cyclin D1, was also due, in part, to loss of Sp proteins. Curcumin also decreased bladder tumor growth in athymic nude mice bearing KU7 cells as xenografts and this was accompanied by decreased Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein levels in tumors. These results show for the first time that one of the underlying mechanisms of action of curcumin as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent is due, in part, to decreased expression of Sp transcription factors in bladder cancer cells.

26963473|t|A Role for Androgens in Epithelial Proliferation and Formation of Glands in the Mouse Uterus.
26963473|a|The endometrium consists of stromal and epithelial compartments (luminal and glandular) with distinct functions in the regulation of uterine homeostasis. Ovarian sex steroids, namely 17b-estradiol and progesterone, play essential roles in modulating uterine cell proliferation, stromal-epithelial cross-talk and differentiation in preparation for pregnancy. The effect of androgens on uterine function remains poorly understood. The current study investigated the effect of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on mouse endometrial function. Ovx female mice were given a single sc injection (short treatment) or 7 daily injections (long treatment) of vehicle alone (5% ethanol, 0.4% methylcellulose) or vehicle with the addition of 0.2 mg DHT (n=8/group) and a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine 2 hours prior to tissue recovery. Treatment with DHT increased uterine weight, the area of the endometrial compartment and immunoexpression of the androgen receptor in the luminal and glandular epithelium. Treatment-dependent proliferation of epithelial cells was identified by immunostaining for MKi67 and bromodeoxyuridine. Real-time PCR identified significant DHT-dependent changes in the concentrations of mRNAs encoded by genes implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle (Wee1, Ccnd1, Rb1) and stromal-epithelial interactions (Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt7a, Cdh1, Vcl, Igf1, Prl8, Prlr) as well as a striking effect on the number of endometrial glands. This study has revealed a novel role for androgens in regulating uterine function with an effect on the glandular compartment of the endometrium. This previously unrecognized role for androgens has implications for our understanding of the role of androgens in regulation of endometrial function and fertility in women.

26743002|t|S. cerevisiae Mre11 recruits conjugated SUMO moieties to facilitate the assembly and function of the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex.
26743002|a|Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomes are the most challenging type of DNA damage. The yeast and mammalian Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 (MRX/N)-Sae2/Ctp1 complex catalyzes the resection of DSBs induced by secondary structures, chemical adducts or covalently-attached proteins. MRX/N also initiates two parallel DNA damage responses-checkpoint phosphorylation and global SUMOylation-to boost a cell's ability to repair DSBs. However, the molecular mechanism of this SUMO-mediated response is not completely known. In this study, we report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11 can non-covalently recruit the conjugated SUMO moieties, particularly the poly-SUMO chain. Mre11 has two evolutionarily-conserved SUMO-interacting motifs, Mre11(SIM1) and Mre11(SIM2), which reside on the outermost surface of Mre11. Mre11(SIM1) is indispensable for MRX assembly. Mre11(SIM2) non-covalently links MRX with the SUMO enzymes (E2/Ubc9 and E3/Siz2) to promote global SUMOylation of DNA repair proteins. Mre11(SIM2) acts independently of checkpoint phosphorylation. During meiosis, the mre11(SIM2) mutant, as for mre11S, rad50S and sae2Delta, allows initiation but not processing of Spo11-induced DSBs. Using MRX and DSB repair as a model, our work reveals a general principle in which the conjugated SUMO moieties non-covalently facilitate the assembly and functions of multi-subunit protein complexes.

23752226|t|AP4 is a mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in colorectal cancer.
23752226|a|The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor AP4/TFAP4/AP-4 is encoded by a c-MYC target gene and displays up-regulation concomitantly with c-MYC in colorectal cancer (CRC) and numerous other tumor types. Here a genome-wide characterization of AP4 DNA binding and mRNA expression was performed using a combination of microarray, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses. Thereby, hundreds of induced and repressed AP4 target genes were identified. Besides many genes involved in the control of proliferation, the AP4 target genes included markers of stemness (LGR5 and CD44) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as SNAIL, E-cadherin/CDH1, OCLN, VIM, FN1, and the Claudins 1, 4, and 7. Accordingly, activation of AP4 induced EMT and enhanced migration and invasion of CRC cells. Conversely, down-regulation of AP4 resulted in mesenchymal-epithelial transition and inhibited migration and invasion. In addition, AP4 induction was required for EMT, migration, and invasion caused by ectopic expression of c-MYC. Inhibition of AP4 in CRC cells resulted in decreased lung metastasis in mice. Elevated AP4 expression in primary CRC significantly correlated with liver metastasis and poor patient survival. These findings imply AP4 as a new regulator of EMT that contributes to metastatic processes in CRC and presumably other carcinomas.

21951951|t|Acute myeloid leukemia of donor origin after allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a sibling who harbors germline XPD and XRCC3 homozygous polymorphisms.
21951951|a|A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed with infiltrative ductal breast carcinoma. Two years after treatment, the patient developed an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which harbored del(11q23) in 8% of the blast cells. The patient was submitted for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT) from her HLA-compatible sister. Ten months after transplantation, she relapsed with an AML with basophilic maturation characterized by CD45(low) CD33(high), CD117+, CD13(-/+), HLA Dr(high), CD123(high), and CD203c+ blast cells lacking expression of CD7, CD10, CD34, CD15, CD14, CD56, CD36, CD64, and cytoplasmic tryptase. Karyotype analysis showed the emergence of a new clone with t(2;14) and FISH analysis indicated the presence of MLL gene rearrangement consistent with del(11q23). Interestingly, AML blast cell DNA tested with microsatellite markers showed the same pattern as the donor's, suggesting that this AML emerged from donor cells. Additionally, polymorphisms of the XPA, XPD, XRCC1, XRCC3 and RAD51 DNA repair genes revealed three unfavorable alleles with low DNA repair capacity.In summary, we report the first case of AML involving XPD and XRCC3 polymorphisms from donor origin following allogeneic stem cell transplantation and highlight the potential need for careful analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in selecting candidate donors prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

24387290|t|XB130 promotes proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells.
24387290|a|BACKGROUND: XB130 has been reported to be expressed by various types of cells such as thyroid cancer and esophageal cancer cells, and it promotes the proliferation and invasion of thyroid cancer cells. Our previous study demonstrated that XB130 is also expressed in gastric cancer (GC), and that its expression is associated with the prognosis, but the role of XB130 in GC has not been well characterized. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the influence of XB130 on gastric tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo and in vitro using the MTT assay, clonogenic assay, BrdU incorporation assay, 3D culture, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Western blot analysis was also performed to identify the potential mechanisms involved. RESULTS: The proliferation, migration, and invasion of SGC7901 and MNK45 gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines were all significantly inhibited by knockdown of XB130 using small hairpin RNA. In a xenograft model, tumor growth was markedly inhibited after shXB130-transfected GC cells were implanted into nude mice. After XB130 knockdown, GC cells showed a more epithelial-like phenotype, suggesting an inhibition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In addition, silencing of XB130 reduced the expression of p-Akt/Akt, upregulated expression of epithelial markers including E-cadherin, a-catenin and b-catenin, and downregulated mesenchymal markers including fibronectin and vimentin. Expression of oncoproteins related to tumor metastasis, such as MMP2, MMP9, and CD44, was also significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that XB130 enhances cell motility and invasiveness by modulating the EMT-like process, while silencing XB130 in GC suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target.

30991764|t|Use of Physcion to Improve Atopic Dermatitis-Like Skin Lesions through Blocking of Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin.
30991764|a|Physcion is well known for the treatment of carcinoma. However, the therapeutic effect of physcion on atopic dermatitis (AD) through the inhibition of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) level remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti-AD effect of physcion using HMC-1 cells, splenocytes, and a murine model. Treatment with physcion decreased production and mRNA expression levels of TSLP, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in activated HMC-1 cells. Physcion reduced the expression levels of RIP2/caspase-1 and phospho (p)ERK/pJNK/pp38 in activated HMC-1 cells. Physcion suppressed the expression levels of pIKKbeta/NF-kappaB/pIkB in activated HMC-1 cells. Moreover, physcion attenuated the production levels of TSLP, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-gamma from activated splenocytes. Oral administration of physcion improved the severity of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene-induced AD-like lesional skin through reducing infiltration of inflammatory cells and mast cells, and the protein and mRNA levels of TSLP, IL-4, and IL-6 in the lesional skin tissues. Physcion attenuated histamine, IgE, TSLP, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF- levels in serum. In addition, physcion inhibited caspase-1 activation in the lesional skin tissues. These findings indicate that physcion could ameliorate AD-like skin lesions by inhibiting TSLP levels via caspase-1/MAPKs/NF-kB signalings, which would provide experimental evidence of the therapeutic potential of physcion for AD.

24402617|t|Mycobacterium massiliense induces inflammatory responses in macrophages through Toll-like receptor 2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
24402617|a|Mycobacterium massiliense (Mmass) is an emerging, rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM) that belongs to the M. abscessus (Mabc) group, albeit clearly differentiated from Mabc. Compared with M. tuberculosis, a well-characterized human pathogen, the host innate immune response against Mmass infection is largely unknown. In this study, we show that Mmass robustly activates mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-6 in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), but neither TLR4 nor Dectin-1, are involved in Mmass-induced TNF-a or IL-6 production in BMDMs. Mmass infection also activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs; c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) pathway. Mmass-induced TNF-a and IL-6 production was dependent on JNK activation, while they were unaffected by either the ERK1/2 or p38 pathway in BMDMs. Additionally, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), NADPH oxidase-2, and nuclear factor-kB are required for Mmass-induced proinflammatory cytokine generation in macrophages. Furthermore, the S morphotype of Mmass showed lower overall induction of pro-inflammatory (TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines than the R morphotype, suggesting fewer immunogenic characteristics for this clinical strain. Together, these results suggest that Mmass-induced activation of host proinflammatory cytokines is mediated through TLR2-dependent JNK and ROS signaling pathways.

23359500|t|Keratinocyte overexpression of IL-17C promotes psoriasiform skin inflammation.
23359500|a|IL-17C is a functionally distinct member of the IL-17 family that binds IL-17 receptor E/A to promote innate defense in epithelial cells and regulate Th17 cell differentiation. We demonstrate that IL-17C (not IL-17A) is the most abundant IL-17 isoform in lesional psoriasis skin (1058 versus 8 pg/ml; p    < 0.006) and localizes to keratinocytes (KCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and leukocytes. ECs stimulated with IL-17C produce increased TNF-alpha and KCs stimulated with IL-17C/TNF-alpha produce similar inflammatory gene response patterns as those elicited by IL-17A/TNF-alpha, including increases in IL-17C, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-1alpha/beta, IL-1F5, IL-1F9, IL-6, IL-19, CCL20, S100A7/A8/A9, DEFB4, lipocalin 2, and peptidase inhibitor 3 (p    < 0.05), indicating a positive proinflammatory feedback loop between the epidermis and ECs. Psoriasis patients treated with etanercept rapidly decrease cutaneous IL-17C levels, suggesting IL-17C/TNF-alpha-mediated inflammatory signaling is critical for psoriasis pathogenesis. Mice genetically engineered to overexpress IL-17C in KCs develop well-demarcated areas of erythematous, flakey involved skin adjacent to areas of normal-appearing uninvolved skin despite increased IL-17C expression in both areas (p    < 0.05). Uninvolved skin displays increased angiogenesis and elevated S100A8/A9 expression (p    < 0.05) but no epidermal hyperplasia, whereas involved skin exhibits robust epidermal hyperplasia, increased angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltration, and upregulated TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha/beta, IL-17A/F, IL-23p19, vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-6, and CCL20 (p    < 0.05), suggesting that IL-17C, when coupled with other proinflammatory signals, initiates the development of psoriasiform dermatitis. This skin phenotype was significantly improved following 8 wk of TNF-alpha inhibition. These findings identify a role for IL-17C in skin inflammation and suggest a pathogenic function for the elevated IL-17C observed in lesional psoriasis skin.

27239034|t|Telomere Replication Stress Induced by POT1 Inactivation Accelerates Tumorigenesis.
27239034|a|Genome sequencing studies have revealed a number of cancer-associated mutations in the telomere-binding factor POT1. Here, we show that when combined with p53 deficiency, depletion of murine POT1a in common lymphoid progenitor cells fosters genetic instability, accelerates the onset, and increases the severity of T cell lymphomas. In parallel, we examined human and mouse cells carrying POT1 mutations found in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients. Inhibition of POT1 activates ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling and induces telomere fragility, replication fork stalling, and telomere elongation. Our data suggest that these phenotypes are linked to impaired CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) function at telomeres. Lastly, we show that proliferation of cancer cells lacking POT1 is enabled by the attenuation of the ATR kinase pathway. These results uncover a role for defective telomere replication during tumorigenesis.

21789165|t|A small peptide modeled after the NRAGE repeat domain inhibits XIAP-TAB1-TAK1 signaling for NF-kB activation and apoptosis in P19 cells.
21789165|a|In normal growth and development, apoptosis is necessary to shape the central nervous system and to eliminate excess neurons which are not required for innervation. In some diseases, however, apoptosis can be either overactive as in some neurodegenerative disorders or severely attenuated as in the spread of certain cancers. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) transmit signals for regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Responding to BMP receptors stimulated from BMP ligands, neurotrophin receptor-mediated MAGE homolog (NRAGE) binds and functions with the XIAP-TAK1-TAB1 complex to activate p38(MAPK) and induces apoptosis in cortical neural progenitors. NRAGE contains a unique repeat domain that is only found in human, mouse, and rat homologs that we theorize is pivotal in its BMP MAPK role. Previously, we showed that deletion of the repeat domain inhibits apoptosis, p38(MAPK) phosphorylation, and caspase-3 cleavage in P19 neural progenitor cells. We also showed that the XIAP-TAB1-TAK1 complex is dependent on NRAGE for IKK-a/b phosphorylation and NF-kB activation. XIAP is a major inhibitor of caspases, the main executioners of apoptosis. Although it has been shown previously that NRAGE binds to the RING domain of XIAP, it has not been determined which NRAGE domain binds to XIAP. Here, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine that there is a strong likelihood of a direct interaction between NRAGE and XIAP occurring at NRAGE's unique repeat domain which we also attribute to be the domain responsible for downstream signaling of NF-kB and activating IKK subunits. From these results, we designed a small peptide modeled after the NRAGE repeat domain which we have determined inhibits NF-kB activation and apoptosis in P19 cells. These intriguing results illustrate that the paradigm of the NRAGE repeat domain may hold promising therapeutic strategies in developing pharmaceutical solutions for combating harmful diseases involving excessive downstream BMP signaling, including apoptosis.

25575814|t|MIG-7 and phosphorylated prohibitin coordinately regulate lung cancer invasion/metastasis.
25575814|a|Growth factors and COX-2/PGE2 enhance lung cancer invasion/metastasis via PI3K/Akt and RAS/Raf. Here, we explored their mechanism of action further. We found first that higher levels of migration inducting gene-7 protein (MIG-7) and PHB phosphorylated at threonine 258 (phospho-PHBT258) are positively correlated with advanced stages of human lung cancer in tissue microarray. PGE2 or growth factors such as EGF, HGF and IGF-1 increased complex formation of phospho-PHBT258 with Ras, phospho-AktS473, phospho-Raf-1S338, MEKK1 and IKKalpha/betaS176/180 in the raft domain transiently within 1 hour and MIG-7 in the cytosol 12-24 hours later. Association of phospho-PHBT258 with MEKK1 but not MEKK3 activates IKK/IkappaB/NF-kappaB and MEK/ERK to increase cellular COX-2/PGE2 and an E-cadherin suppressor Snail leading to enhancement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung cancer migration/invasion. MIG-7, on the other hand, was induced by growth factors and PGE2 via Akt/GSK-3beta in a phospho-PHBT258 independent manner. MIG-7 increased two E-cadherin suppressors ZEB-1 and Twist to enhance EMT and cancer migration/invasion. Downregulating phospho-PHBT258 and MIG-7 had an additive effect on attenuating lung cancer invasion/metastasis and prolonging the survival of xenograft mice. Phospho-PHBT258 and MIG-7 may thus play complementary roles in the initiation and sustainment of the effects of growth factors and COX-2/PGE2 on cancer invasion/metastasis.

19463742|t|Melanocortin-4 receptor activation inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity and promotes insulin signaling.
19463742|a|The melanocortin system is crucial to regulation of energy homeostasis. The melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) modulates insulin signaling via effects on c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The melanocortin agonist NDP-MSH dose-dependently inhibited JNK activity in HEK293 cells stably expressing the human MC4R; effects were reversed by melanocortin receptor antagonist. NDP-MSH time- and dose-dependently inhibited IRS-1(ser307) phosphorylation, effects also reversed by a specific melanocortin receptor antagonist. NDP-MSH augmented insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in vitro. The melanocortin agonist melanotan II increased insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in the rat hypothalamus in vivo. NDP-MSH increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in hypothalamic GT1-1 cells. The current study shows that the melanocortinergic system interacts with insulin signaling via novel effects on JNK activity.

27871326|t|Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 and 5-HT7 receptor preferentially expressed in triple-negative breast cancer promote cancer progression through autocrine serotonin signaling.
27871326|a|BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a high risk of relapse and there are few chemotherapy options. Although 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) signaling pathways have been suggested as potential targets for anti-cancer drug development, the mechanism responsible for the action of 5-HT in TNBC remains unknown. METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to measure mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Cell proliferation was measured using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution. siRNA transfection was used to assess involvement of genes in cancer invasion, which were identified by Matrigel transwell invasion assay. Levels of 5-HT and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured using ELISA kits. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and mouse tumor model were used to investigate the in vivo effects of SB269970, a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and BJ-1113, a novel synthetic compound. RESULTS: TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, HCC-1395, and Hs578T) expressed higher levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) than hormone-responsive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D). In MDA-MB-231 cells, 5-HT promoted invasion and proliferation via 5-HT7 receptor, and interestingly, the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was stronger than its effect on proliferation. Likewise, downstream signaling pathways of 5-HT7 differed during invasion and proliferation, that is, Ga-activated cAMP and Gbg-activated kinase signaling during invasion, and Gbg-activated PI3K/Akt signaling during proliferation. Also, 5-HT increased the protein expressions of TPH1 and VEGF in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results provide insight of the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on breast cancer progression; 5-HT was found to act more strongly during the first stage of metastasis (during invasion and migration) than during the later proliferative phase after local invasion. Interestingly, these actions of 5-HT were inhibited by BJ-1113, a 6-amino-2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ol analog. BJ-1113 blocked intracellular signaling pathways initiated by 5-HT7 receptor activation, and exhibited anti-proliferative and anti-invasive activities against MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of BJ-1113 against MDA-MB-231 tumor growth was greater than that of SB269970, a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: 5-HT7 receptor which mediates 5-HT-induced cancer progression is a potential therapeutic target in TNBC, and BJ-1113 offers a novel scaffold for the development of anti-cancer agents against TNBC.

20821041|t|TLR1/2, TLR7, and TLR9 signals directly activate human peripheral blood naive and memory B cell subsets to produce cytokines, chemokines, and hematopoietic growth factors.
20821041|a|Recently, it has been reported that using multiple signals, murine and human B cells secrete several cytokines with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. We present the first comprehensive analysis of 24 cytokines, chemokines, and hematopoietic growth factors production by purified human peripheral blood B cells (CD19+), and naive (CD19+CD27-) and memory (CD19+CD27+) B cells in response to direct and exclusive signaling provided by toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands Pam3CSK (TLR1/TLR2), Imiquimod (TLR7), and GpG-ODN2006 (TLR9). All three TLR ligands stimulated B cells (CD19+) to produce cytokines IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-13, and IL-10, and chemokines MIP-1a, MIP-1b, MCP-1, IP-10, and IL-8. However, GM-CSF and G-CSF production was predominantly induced by TLR2 agonist. Most cytokines/chemokines/hematopoietic growth factors were predominantly or exclusively produced by memory B cells, and in general, TLR2 signal was more powerful than signal provided viaTLR7 and TLR9. No significant secretion of eotaxin, IFN-a, IFN-g, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-15, IL-17, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, and TNF-b (lymphotoxin) was observed. These data demonstrate that human B cells can be directly activated viaTLR1/TLR2, TLR7, and TLR9 to induce secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and hematopoietic growth factors and suggest a role of B cells in immune response against microbial pathogenesis and immune homeostasis.

30377154|t|The Yeast DNA Damage Checkpoint Kinase Rad53 Targets the Exoribonuclease, Xrn1.
30377154|a|The highly conserved DNA damage response (DDR) pathway monitors the genomic integrity of the cell and protects against genotoxic stresses. The apical kinases, Mec1 and Tel1 (ATR and ATM in human, respectively), initiate the DNA damage signaling cascade through the effector kinases, Rad53 and Chk1, to regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling, and transcription. The DDR also regulates other cellular pathways, but direct substrates and mechanisms are still lacking. Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified novel targets of Rad53, many of which are proteins that are involved in RNA metabolism. Of the 33 novel substrates identified, we verified that 12 are directly phosphorylated by Rad53 in vitro: Xrn1, Gcd11, Rps7b, Ded1, Cho2, Pus1, Hst1, Srv2, Set3, Snu23, Alb1, and Scp160. We further characterized Xrn1, a highly conserved 5' exoribonuclease that functions in RNA degradation and the most enriched in our phosphoproteomics screen. Phosphorylation of Xrn1 by Rad53 does not appear to affect Xrn1's intrinsic nuclease activity in vitro, but may affect its activity or specificity in vivo.

19811499|t|Independent and cooperative roles of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor-kappaB, and bone morphogenetic protein-2 in regulation of metastasis and osteomimicry of prostate cancer cells and differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.
19811499|a|The molecular mechanisms involved in prostate cancer (PC) metastasis and bone remodeling are poorly understood. We recently reported that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) mediates transcriptional regulation and activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 signaling by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in bone metastatic prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that NF-kappaB, whether activated by recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha or by ectopic expression of the p65 subunit, is involved in extracellular matrix adhesion and invasion of osteotropic PC-3 and C4-2B, but not LNCaP, cells. The enhanced metastatic potential was associated with transcriptional upregulation of osteopontin, osteocalcin, and collagen IA1 in osteotropic PC cells, suggesting their role in osteomimicry of PC cells. Unlike BMP-4, BMP-2 protein enhanced the invasive properties of C4-2B cells, but not in LNCaP cells. Also, this effect was nullified by Noggin. In addition, BMP-2 mediates TNF-alpha-induced invasion of C4-2B cells in a NF-kappaB-dependent fashion. TNF-alpha or conditioned media (CM) of TNF-alpha-stimulated C4-2B cells upregulated BMP-2 and BMP-dependent Smad transcripts and inhibited receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand transcripts in RAW 264.7 preosteoclast cells, respectively, implying that this factor may contribute to suppression of osteoclastogenesis via direct and paracrine mechanisms. In contrast, CM of TNF-alpha-stimulate or BMP2-stimulated C4-2B cells induced in vitro mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells in a BMP-2-dependent and NF-kappaB-dependent manner, respectively. Taken together, the results suggest that mutual interactions between these factors may be pivotal not only in enhancing the osteomimicry and metastatic potential of PC cells, but also in bone remodeling and in shifting the balance from osteoclastogenesis towards osteoblastogenesis.

23219801|t|What can naturally occurring mutations tell us about Ca(v)1.x channel function?
23219801|a|Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels allow for Ca2+-dependent intracellular signaling by directly mediating Ca2+ ion influx, by physical coupling to intracellular Ca2+ release channels or functional coupling to other ion channels such as Ca2+ activated potassium channels. L-type Ca2+ channels that comprise the family of Ca(v)1 channels are expressed in many electrically excitable tissues and are characterized by their unique sensitivity to dihydropyridines. In this issue, we summarize genetic defects in L-type Ca2+ channels and analyze their role in human diseases (Ca2+ channelopathies); e.g. mutations in Ca(v)1.2 a1 cause Timothy and Brugada syndrome, mutations in Ca(v)1.3 a1 are linked to sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness while mutations in Ca(v)1.4 a1 are associated with X-linked retinal disorders such as an incomplete form of congenital stationary night blindness. Herein, we also put the mutations underlying the channel's dysfunction into the structural context of the pore-forming a1 subunit. This analysis highlights the importance of combining functional data with structural analysis to gain a deeper understanding for the disease pathophysiology as well as for physiological channel function.

22495828|t|Knockdown of cathepsin B and uPAR inhibits CD151 and a3b1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion and invasion in glioma.
22495828|a|Glioma is a highly complex brain tumor characterized by the dysregulation of proteins and genes that leads to tumor metastasis. Cathepsin B and uPAR are overexpressed in gliomas and they are postulated to play central roles in glioma metastasis. In this study, efficient downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR by siRNA treatments significantly reduced glioma cell adhesion to laminin as compared to vitronectin, fibronectin, or collagen I in U251 and 4910 glioma cell lines. Brain glioma tissue array analysis showed high expression of CD151 in clinical samples when compared with normal brain tissue. Cathepsin B and uPAR siRNA treatment led to the downregulation of CD151 and laminin-binding integrins a3 and b1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR decreased the interaction of CD151 with uPAR cathepsin B, and a3b1 integrin. Studies on the downstream signaling cascade of uPAR/CD151/a3b1 integrin have shown that phosphorylation of FAK, SRC, paxillin, and expression of adaptor cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin were reduced with knockdown of cathepsin B, uPAR, and CD151. Treatment with the bicistronic construct reduced interactions between uPAR and CD151 as well as lowering a3b1 integrin, talin, and vinculin expression levels in pre-established glioma tumors of nude mice. In conclusion, our results show that downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR alone and in combination inhibit glioma cell adhesion by downregulating CD151 and its associated signaling molecules in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the results of the present study show that targeting the uPAR-cathepsin B system has possible therapeutic potential.

28075473|t|Spirulina lipopolysaccharides inhibit tumor growth in a Toll-like receptor 4-dependent manner by altering the cytokine milieu from interleukin-17/interleukin-23 to interferon-g.
28075473|a|Th17 cells and the cytokine they produce, interleukin (IL)-17, play an important role in tumor progression in humans and in mice. IL-6 and IL-23 are critical cytokines for the differentiation and propagation of Th17 cells, respectively. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are known to stimulate immune cells to produce such inflammatory cytokines. Contrary to Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS, LPS from Spirulina has low toxicity and barely induces in vivo production of IL-6 and IL-23 in mice. We examined the antitumor effects of Spirulina LPS compared to E. coli LPS in an MH134 hepatoma model. Administration of Spirulina LPS suppressed tumor growth in C3H/HeN mice, but not in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mutant C3H/HeJ mice, by reducing serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23, while increasing interferon (IFN)-g levels. The antitumor activity and IFN-g production were mediated by T cells. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that Spirulina LPS impaired the antigen-presenting function that supports the generation of IL-17-producing cells in a toll-like receptor (TLR)4-dependent manner. Of note, injection of anti-IL-17 antibody in tumor-bearing C3H/HeN mice in the absence of Spirulina LPS markedly suppressed tumor growth and augmented IFN-g responses. Thus, our results support the notion that IFN-g and IL-17/IL-23 mutually regulate Th17 and Th1 responses in tumor-bearing hosts, and Spirulina LPS modulates the balance of the IFN-g-IL-17/IL-23 axis towards IFN-g production, which leads to tumor inhibition. Furthermore, Spirulina LPS effectively inhibited the spontaneous development of mammary tumors. This study has important implications for the exploitation of TLR-based immunomodulators for cancer immunotherapy.

27959382|t|Bach1 siRNA attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by modulating oxidative stress in mice.
27959382|a|Oxidative stress plays an essential role in inflammation and fibrosis. Bach1 is an important transcriptional repressor that acts by modulating oxidative stress and represents a potential target in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). In this study, we knocked down Bach1 using adenovirus-mediated small interfering RNA (siRNA) to determine whether the use of Bach1 siRNA is an effective therapeutic strategy in mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF. Mouse lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were incubated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-b1 (5 ng/ml) and subsequently infected with recombined adenovirus-like Bach1 siRNA1 and Bach1 siRNA2, while an empty adenovirus vector was used as the negative control. The selected Bach1 siRNA with higher interference efficiency was used for the animal experiments. A mouse model of BLM-induced PF was established, and Bach1 siRNA (1x109 pfu) was administered to the mice via the tail vein. The results revealed that the Bach1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly downregulated by Bach1 siRNA. Furthermore, the MLFs infected with Bach1 siRNA exhibited increased mRNA and protein expression levels of heme oxygenase-1 and glutathione peroxidase 1, but decreased levels of TGF-b1 and interleukin-6 in the cell supernatants compared with the cells exposed to TGF-b1 alone. Bach1 knockdown by siRNA also enhanced the expression of antioxidant factors, but suppressed that of fibrosis-related cytokines in mice compared with the BLM group. Finally, the inflammatory infiltration of alveolar and interstitial cells and the destruction of lung structure were significantly attenuated in the mide administered Bach1 siRNA compared with those in the BLM group. On the whole, our findings demonstrate that Bach1 siRNA exerts protective effects against BLM-induced PF in mice. Our data may provide the basis for the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies for PF.

24705272|t|Reversal of ischemic cardiomyopathy with Sca-1+ stem cells modified with multiple growth factors.
24705272|a|BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that bone marrow derived Sca-1+ stem cells (BM Sca-1+) transduced with multiple therapeutic cytokines with diverse effects will induce faster angiomyogenic differentiation in the infarcted myocardium. METHODS AND RESULTS: BM Sca-1+ were purified from transgenic male mice expressing GFP. Plasmids encoding for select quartet of growth factors, i.e., human IGF-1, VEGF, SDF-1a and HGF were prepared and used for genetic modification of Sca-1+ cells (GFSca-1+). Scramble transfected cells (ScSca-1+) were used as a control. RT-PCR and western blotting showed significantly higher expression of the growth factors in GFSca-1+. Besides the quartet of the therapeutic growth factors, PCR based growth factor array showed upregulation of multiple angiogenic and prosurvival factors such as Ang-1, Ang-2, MMP9, Cx43, BMP2, BMP5, FGF2, and NGF in GFSca-1+ (p<0.01 vs ScSca-1+). LDH and TUNEL assays showed enhanced survival of GFSca-1+ under lethal anoxia (p<0.01 vs ScSca-1+). MTS assay showed significant increased cell proliferation in GFSca-1+ (p<0.05 vs ScSca-1+). For in vivo study, female mice were grouped to receive the intramyocardial injection of 15 ul DMEM without cells (group-1) or containing 2.5 x 10(5) ScSca-1+ (group-2) or GFSca-1+ (group-3) immediately after coronary artery ligation. As indicated by Sry gene, a higher survival of GFSca-1+ in group-3 on day 4 (2.3 fold higher vs group-2) was observed with massive mobilization of stem and progenitor cells (cKit+, Mdr1+, Cxcr4+ cells). Heart tissue sections immunostained for actinin and Cx43 at 4 weeks post engraftment showed extensive myofiber formation and expression of gap junctions. Immunostaining for vWF showed increased blood vessel density in both peri-infarct and infarct regions in group-3. Infarct size was attenuated and the global heart function was improved in group-3 as compared to group-2. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of BM Sca-1+ transduced with multiple genes is a novel approach to treat infarcted heart for its regeneration.

21431351|t|Deletion of growth hormone receptor gene but not visceral fat removal decreases expression of apoptosis-related genes in the kidney-potential mechanism of lifespan extension.
21431351|a|Mice homozygous for the targeted disruption of the growth hormone (GH) receptor (Ghr) gene (GH receptor knockout; GHRKO; KO) are hypoinsulinemic, highly insulin sensitive, normoglycemic, and long-lived. Visceral fat removal (VFR) is a surgical intervention which improves insulin signaling in normal (N) mice and rats and extends longevity in rats. We have previously demonstrated decreased expression level of certain pro-apoptotic genes in skeletal muscles and suggested that this may contribute to the regulation of longevity in GHRKO mice. Alterations in apoptosis-related genes expression in the kidneys also may potentially lead to lifespan extension. In this context, we decided to examine the renal expression of the following genes: caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-8, bax, bad, bcl-2, Smac/DIABLO, Apaf-1, p53, and cytochrome c1 (cyc1) in male GHRKO and N mice subjected to VFR or sham surgery, at approximately 6 months of age. The kidneys were collected 2 months after VFR. As a result, caspase-3, caspase-9, and bax expressions were decreased in KO mice as compared to N animals. Expressions of Smac/DIABLO, caspase-8, bcl-2, bad, and p53 did not differ between KOs and N mice. VFR did not change the expression of the examined genes in KO or N mice. In conclusion, endocrine abnormalities in GHRKO mice result in decreased expression of pro-apoptotic genes and VFR did not alter the examined genes expression in N and KO mice. These data are consistent with a model in which alterations of GH signaling and/or insulin sensitivity lead to increased lifespan mediated by decreased renal expression of pro-apoptotic genes.

20561923|t|Subtilase cytotoxin induces apoptosis in HeLa cells by mitochondrial permeabilization via activation of Bax/Bak, independent of C/EBF-homologue protein (CHOP), Ire1alpha or JNK signaling.
20561923|a|Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is an AB(5) cytotoxin produced by some strains of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli. The A subunit is a subtilase-like serine protease and cleaves an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, BiP, leading to transient inhibition of protein synthesis and cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase, and inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis via mitochondrial membrane damage in Vero cells. Here we investigated the mechanism of mitochondrial permeabilization in HeLa cells. SubAB-induced cytochrome c release into cytosol did not depend on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), since cyclosporine A did not suppress cytochrome c release. SubAB did not change the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and pro-apoptotic Bax or Bak, but triggered Bax and Bak conformational changes and association of Bax with Bak. Silencing using siRNA of both bax and bak genes, but not bax, bak, or bim alone, resulted in reduction of cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, DNA ladder formation and cytotoxicity, indicating that Bax and Bak were involved in apoptosis. SubAB activated ER transmembrane transducers, Ire1alpha, and cJun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and induced C/EBF-homologue protein (CHOP). To investigate whether these signals were involved in cytochrome c release by Bax activation, we silenced ire1alpha, jnk or chop; however, silencing did not decrease SubAB-induced cytochrome c release, suggesting that these signals were not necessary for SubAB-induced mitochondrial permeabilization by Bax activation.

17319906|t|A major role for Scar/WAVE-1 downstream of GPVI in platelets.
17319906|a|BACKGROUND: The small GTPase Rac1 plays a critical role in lamellipodia assembly in platelets on matrix proteins in the absence or presence of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists. Rac mediates actin assembly via Scar/WAVE, a family of scaffolding proteins that direct actin reorganization by relaying signals from Rac to the Arp2/3 complex. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of Scar/WAVE-1 in mediating platelet activation and cytoskeletal reorganization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using specific antibodies, we demonstrate that murine platelets, like human platelets, express Scar/WAVE-1 and Scar/WAVE-2. Lamellipodia formation in Scar/WAVE-1(-/-) platelets is markedly inhibited on immobilized collagen-related peptide (CRP) and on laminin, both of which signal through the collagen receptor GPVI. In contrast, lamellipodia formation on collagen, which requires release of the GPCR agonists ADP and thromboxane A(2), is not altered. Immobilized fibrinogen supports limited formation of lamellipodia in murine platelets, which is not altered in Scar/WAVE-1(-/-) platelets. As with Rac1(-/-) platelets, Scar/WAVE-1(-/-) platelets exhibit a marked inhibition of aggregation in response to CRP, whereas the response to the GPCR agonist thrombin is not altered. Platelet aggregation on immobilized collagen under shear, which is dependent on signaling by matrix and GPCR agonists, was unaltered in the absence of Scar/WAVE-1. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a major role for Scar/WAVE-1 in mediating platelet cytoskeletal reorganization and aggregate formation downstream of activation by GPVI but not by GPCR agonists.

23860123|t|Tcf19 is a novel islet factor necessary for proliferation and survival in the INS-1 b-cell line.
23860123|a|Recently, a novel type 1 diabetes association locus was identified at human chromosome 6p31.3, and transcription factor 19 (TCF19) is a likely causal gene. Little is known about Tcf19, and we now show that it plays a role in both proliferation and apoptosis in insulinoma cells. Tcf19 is expressed in mouse and human islets, with increasing mRNA expression in nondiabetic obesity. The expression of Tcf19 is correlated with b-cell mass expansion, suggesting that it may be a transcriptional regulator of b-cell mass. Increasing proliferation and decreasing apoptotic cell death are two strategies to increase pancreatic b-cell mass and prevent or delay diabetes. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Tcf19 in the INS-1 insulinoma cell line, a b-cell model, results in a decrease in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. There was a significant reduction in the expression of numerous cell cycle genes from the late G1 phase through the M phase, and cells were arrested at the G1/S checkpoint. We also observed increased apoptosis and susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after Tcf19 knockdown. There was a reduction in expression of genes important for the maintenance of ER homeostasis (Bip, p58(IPK), Edem1, and calreticulin) and an increase in proapoptotic genes (Bim, Bid, Nix, Gadd34, and Pdia2). Therefore, Tcf19 is necessary for both proliferation and survival and is a novel regulator of these pathways.

28851297|t|An Ag-globin G->A gene polymorphism associated with b(0)39 thalassemia globin gene and high fetal hemoglobin production.
28851297|a|BACKGROUND: Increase of the expression of g-globin gene and high production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in b-thalassemia patients is widely accepted as associated with a milder or even asymptomatic disease. The search for HbF-associated polymorphisms (such as the XmnI, BCL11A and MYB polymorphisms) has recently gained great attention, in order to stratify b-thalassemia patients with respect to expectancy of the first transfusion, need for annual intake of blood, response to HbF inducers (the most studied of which is hydroxyurea). METHODS: Ag-globin gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated from a total of 75 b-thalassemia patients, including 31 b(0)39/b(0)39, 33 b(0)39/b(+)IVSI-110, 9 b(+)IVSI-110/b(+)IVSI-110, one b(0)IVSI-1/b(+)IVSI-6 and one b(0)39/b(+)IVSI-6. RESULTS: The results show that the rs368698783 polymorphism is present in b-thalassemia patients in the 5'UTR sequence (+25) of the Ag-globin gene, known to affect the LYAR (human homologue of mouse Ly-1 antibody reactive clone) binding site 5'-GGTTAT-3'. This Ag(+25 G->A) polymorphism is associated with the Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphism and both are linked with the b(0)39-globin gene, but not with the b(+)IVSI-110-globin gene. In agreement with the expectation that this mutation alters the LYAR binding activity, we found that the Ag(+25 G->A) and Gg-globin-XmnI polymorphisms are associated with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells isolated from b(0)39/b(0)39 thalassemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: As a potential explanation of our findings, we hypothesize that in b-thalassemia the Gg-globin-XmnI/Ag-globin-(G->A) genotype is frequently under genetic linkage with b(0)-thalassemia mutations, but not with the b(+)-thalassemia mutation here studied (i.e. b(+)IVSI-110) and that this genetic combination has been selected within the population of b(0)-thalassemia patients, due to functional association with high HbF. Here we describe the characterization of the rs368698783 (+25 G->A) polymorphism of the Ag-globin gene associated in b(0)39 thalassemia patients with high HbF in erythroid precursor cells.

26847345|t|Transgelin increases metastatic potential of colorectal cancer cells in vivo and alters expression of genes involved in cell motility.
26847345|a|BACKGROUND: Transgelin is an actin-binding protein that promotes motility in normal cells. Although the role of transgelin in cancer is controversial, a number of studies have shown that elevated levels correlate with aggressive tumor behavior, advanced stage, and poor prognosis. Here we sought to determine the role of transgelin more directly by determining whether experimental manipulation of transgelin levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells led to changes in metastatic potential in vivo. METHODS: Isogenic CRC cell lines that differ in transgelin expression were characterized using in vitro assays of growth and invasiveness and a mouse tail vein assay of experimental metastasis. Downstream effects of transgelin overexpression were investigated by gene expression profiling and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Stable overexpression of transgelin in RKO cells, which have low endogenous levels, led to increased invasiveness, growth at low density, and growth in soft agar. Overexpression also led to an increase in the number and size of lung metastases in the mouse tail vein injection model. Similarly, attenuation of transgelin expression in HCT116 cells, which have high endogenous levels, decreased metastases in the same model. Investigation of mRNA expression patterns showed that transgelin overexpression altered the levels of approximately 250 other transcripts, with over-representation of genes that affect function of actin or other cytoskeletal proteins. Changes included increases in HOOK1, SDCCAG8, ENAH/Mena, and TNS1 and decreases in EMB, BCL11B, and PTPRD. CONCLUSIONS: Increases or decreases in transgelin levels have reciprocal effects on tumor cell behavior, with higher expression promoting metastasis. Chronic overexpression influences steady-state levels of mRNAs for metastasis-related genes.

24694877|t|Embelin suppresses growth of human pancreatic cancer xenografts, and pancreatic cancer cells isolated from KrasG12D mice by inhibiting Akt and Sonic hedgehog pathways.
24694877|a|Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease, and therefore effective treatment and/or prevention strategies are urgently needed. The objectives of this study were to examine the molecular mechanisms by which embelin inhibited human pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro, and xenografts in Balb C nude mice, and pancreatic cancer cell growth isolated from KrasG12D transgenic mice. XTT assays were performed to measure cell viability. AsPC-1 cells were injected subcutaneously into Balb c nude mice and treated with embelin. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by Ki67 and TUNEL staining, respectively. The expression of Akt, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and their target gene products were measured by the immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The effects of embelin on pancreatic cancer cells isolated from 10-months old KrasG12D mice were also examined. Embelin inhibited cell viability in pancreatic cancer AsPC-1, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 and Hs 766T cell lines, and these inhibitory effects were blocked either by constitutively active Akt or Shh protein. Embelin-treated mice showed significant inhibition in tumor growth which was associated with reduced expression of markers of cell proliferation (Ki67, PCNA and Bcl-2) and cell cycle (cyclin D1, CDK2, and CDK6), and induction of apoptosis (activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP, and increased expression of Bax). In addition, embelin inhibited the expression of markers of angiogenesis (COX-2, VEGF, VEGFR, and IL-8), and metastasis (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in tumor tissues. Antitumor activity of embelin was associated with inhibition of Akt and Shh pathways in xenografts, and pancreatic cancer cells isolated from KrasG12D mice. Furthermore, embelin also inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by up-regulating E-cadherin and inhibiting the expression of Snail, Slug, and ZEB1. These data suggest that embelin can inhibit pancreatic cancer growth, angiogenesis and metastasis by suppressing Akt and Shh pathways, and can be developed for the treatment and/or prevention of pancreatic cancer.

20105280|t|Activated Ras alters lens and corneal development through induction of distinct downstream targets.
20105280|a|BACKGROUND: Mammalian Ras genes regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation and are frequently mutated in human cancers. Tumor development in response to Ras activation varies between different tissues and the molecular basis for these variations are poorly understood. The murine lens and cornea have a common embryonic origin and arise from adjacent regions of the surface ectoderm. Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway induces the corneal epithelial cells to proliferate and the lens epithelial cells to exit the cell cycle. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the differential responses of these two related tissues have not been defined. We have generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of human H-Ras in their lenses and corneas. RESULTS: Ras transgenic lenses and corneal epithelial cells showed increased proliferation with concomitant increases in cyclin D1 and D2 expression. This initial increase in proliferation is sustained in the cornea but not in the lens epithelial cells. Coincidentally, cdk inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were upregulated in the Ras transgenic lenses but not in the corneas. Phospho-Erk1 and Erk2 levels were elevated in the lens but not in the cornea and Spry 1 and Spry 2, negative regulators of Ras-Raf-Erk signaling, were upregulated more in the corneal than in the lens epithelial cells. Both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to Ras activation. Ras transgenic embryos showed a distinctive alteration in the architecture of the lens pit. Ras activation, though sufficient for upregulation of Prox1, a transcription factor critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation, is not sufficient for induction of terminal fiber differentiation. Expression of Keratin 12, a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was reduced in the Ras transgenic corneas. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that Ras activation a) induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses and b) is sufficient for initiation but not completion of lens fiber differentiation.

27050163|t|Knockdown of Carboxypeptidase A6 in Zebrafish Larvae Reduces Response to Seizure-Inducing Drugs and Causes Changes in the Level of mRNAs Encoding Signaling Molecules.
27050163|a|Carboxypeptidase A6 (CPA6) is an extracellular matrix metallocarboxypeptidase that modulates peptide and protein function by removal of hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids. Mutations in the human CPA6 gene that reduce enzymatic activity in the extracellular matrix are associated with febrile seizures, temporal lobe epilepsy, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The characterization of these human mutations suggests a dominant mode of inheritance by haploinsufficiency through loss of function mutations, however the total number of humans with pathologic mutations in CPA6 identified to date remains small. To better understand the relationship between CPA6 and seizures we investigated the effects of morpholino knockdown of cpa6 mRNA in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. Knockdown of cpa6 mRNA resulted in resistance to the effect of seizure-inducing drugs pentylenetetrazole and pilocarpine on swimming behaviors. Knockdown of cpa6 mRNA also reduced the levels of mRNAs encoding neuropeptide precursors (bdnf, npy, chga, pcsk1nl, tac1, nts, edn1), a neuropeptide processing enzyme (cpe), transcription factor (c-fos), and molecules implicated in glutamatergic signaling (grin1a and slc1a2b). Treatment of zebrafish embryos with 60 mM pilocarpine for 1 hour led to reductions in levels of many of the same mRNAs when measured 1 day after pilocarpine exposure, except for c-fos which was elevated 1 day after pilocarpine treatment. Pilocarpine treatment, like cpa6 knockdown, led to a reduced sensitivity to pentylenetetrazole when tested 1 day after pilocarpine treatment. Taken together, these results add to mounting evidence that peptidergic systems participate in the biological effects of seizure-inducing drugs, and are the first in vivo demonstration of the molecular and behavioral consequences of cpa6 insufficiency.

21607759|t|Aberrant expression of costimulatory molecules in splenocytes of the mevalonate kinase-deficient mouse model of human hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS).
21607759|a|OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the activation status and proliferative capacities of splenic lymphocyte populations from a mevalonate kinase-deficient mouse model of hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS). We previously reported that murine mevalonate kinase gene ablation was embryonic lethal for homozygous mutants while heterozygotes (Mvk (+/-)) demonstrated several phenotypic features of human HIDS including increased serum levels of IgD, IgA, and TNFa, temperature dysregulation, hematological abnormalities, and splenomegaly. METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface activation markers on T and B lymphocytes, and macrophage populations, demonstrated aberrant expression of B7 glycoproteins in all splenic cell types studied. Differences in expression levels between Mvk (+/-) and Mvk (+/+) littermate controls were observed in both the basal state (unstimulated) and after Concanavalin A (Con-A) stimulation in vitro of whole splenocyte cultures. In Mvk (+/-) CD4 and CD8 T cells, alterations in expression of CD25, CD80, CD152, and CD28 were observed. Mvk (+/-) splenic macrophages expressed altered levels of CD80, CD86, CD40, and CD11c while Mvk (+/-) B lymphocytes had differential expression of CD40, CD80, and CD86. Mvk (+/-) splenocyte subpopulations also exhibited altered proliferative capacities in response to in vitro stimulation. CONCLUSION: We postulate that imbalances in the expression of cell surface proteins necessary for activation, proliferation, and regulation of the intensity and duration of an immune response may result in defective T cell activation, proliferation, and effector functions in our model and potentially in human HIDS.

30836660|t|Salidroside Ameliorates Renal Interstitial Fibrosis by Inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kappaB and MAPK Signaling Pathways.
30836660|a|Salidroside (Sal) is an active ingredient that is isolated from Rhodiola rosea, which has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activities and a renal protective effect. However, the role of Sal on renal fibrosis has not yet been elucidated. Here, the purpose of the current study is to test the protective effects of Sal against renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF), and to explore the underlying mechanisms using both in vivo and in vitro models. In this study, we establish the unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) or folic acid (FA)-induced mice renal interstitial fibrosis in vivo and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-stimulated human proximal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2) model in vitro. The levels of kidney functional parameters and inflammatory cytokines in serum are examined. The degree of renal damage and fibrosis is determined by histological assessment. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting are used to determine the mechanisms of Sal against RIF. Our results show that treatment with Sal can ameliorate tubular injury and deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components (including collagen SH and collagen I). Furthermore, Sal administration significantly suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by a decreased expression of alpha-SMA, vimentin, TGF-beta1, snail, slug, and a largely restored expression of E-cadherin. Additionally, Sal also reduces the levels of serum biochemical markers (serum creatinine, Scr; blood urea nitrogen, BUN; and uric acid, UA) and decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha). Further study revealed that the effect of Sal on renal interstitial fibrosis is associated with the lower expression of TLR4, p-IkappaBalpha, p-NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, Sal treatment improves kidney function, ameliorates the deposition of the ECM components and relieves the protein levels of EMT markers in mouse kidneys and HK-2 cells. Furthermore, Sal treatment significantly decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines and inhibits the TLR4/NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. Collectively, these results suggest that the administration of Sal could be a novel therapeutic strategy in treating renal fibrosis.

20856928|t|Microparticles carrying Sonic hedgehog favor neovascularization through the activation of nitric oxide pathway in mice.
20856928|a|BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) are vesicles released from plasma membrane upon cell activation and during apoptosis. Human T lymphocytes undergoing activation and apoptosis generate MPs bearing morphogen Shh (MPs(Shh+)) that are able to regulate in vitro angiogenesis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we investigated the ability of MPs(Shh+) to modulate neovascularization in a model of mouse hind limb ischemia. Mice were treated in vivo for 21 days with vehicle, MPs(Shh+), MPs(Shh+) plus cyclopamine or cyclopamine alone, an inhibitor of Shh signalling. Laser doppler analysis revealed that the recovery of the blood flow was 1.4 fold higher in MPs(Shh+)-treated mice than in controls, and this was associated with an activation of Shh pathway in muscles and an increase in NO production in both aorta and muscles. MPs(Shh+)-mediated effects on flow recovery and NO production were completely prevented when Shh signalling was inhibited by cyclopamine. In aorta, MPs(Shh+) increased activation of eNOS/Akt pathway, and VEGF expression, being inhibited by cyclopamine. By contrast, in muscles, MPs(Shh+) enhanced eNOS expression and phosphorylation and decreased caveolin-1 expression, but cyclopamine prevented only the effects of MPs(Shh+) on eNOS pathway. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that MPs(Shh+) treatment increased FGF5, FGF2, VEGF A and C mRNA levels and decreased those of alpha5-integrin, FLT-4, HGF, IGF-1, KDR, MCP-1, MT1-MMP, MMP-2, TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, TSP-1 and VCAM-1, in ischemic muscles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that MPs(Shh+) may contribute to reparative neovascularization after ischemic injury by regulating NO pathway and genes involved in angiogenesis.

26515759|t|Establishment and characterization of a novel MYC/BCL2 "double-hit" diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell line, RC.
26515759|a|BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of lymphoid malignancy worldwide. Approximately 5 % of cases of DLBCL are so-called double-hit lymphomas (DHL), defined by a chromosomal translocation or rearrangement involving MYC/8q24.2 in combination with another recurrent breakpoint, usually BCL2/18q21.3. Patients with MYC/BCL2 DHL are resistant to standard front-line therapy, and currently, there is no consensus for a therapeutic strategy to treat these patients. Lack of clinically relevant or validated human experimental DHL models of any type that would improve our understanding of the biologic basis of MYC/BCL2 DHL pathophysiology continues to hamper identification of valid therapeutic targets. We describe a unique MYC/BCL2 DHL cell line with morphologic features of DLBCL that we have established, designated as RC. METHODS: We used tissue culture techniques to establish the RC cell line from primary DLBCL cells. We also utilized molecular and cellular biological techniques including flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA fingerprinting, reverse-phase protein array, conventional cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to characterize the RC cell line. NSG-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were utilized as a model for xeno-transplantation of RC cells. RESULTS: RC cells had the following immunophenotype: positive for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD38, CD43, CD44, and CD79b and negative for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD11c, CD14, CD30, CD56, and CD200, which was identical to the primary tumor cells. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a t(2;8)(p12;q24.2) and t(14;18)(q32;q21.3), corresponding to MYC and BCL2 gene rearrangements, respectively. DNA fingerprinting authenticated the RC cell line to be of the same clone as the primary tumor cells. In addition, RC cells were established in SCID mice as an in vivo model for translational therapeutics studies. Proteomic analysis showed activation of the mTOR signaling pathway in RC cells that can be targeted with an mTOR inhibitor. CONCLUSION: The data presented confirm the validity of the RC cell line as a representative model of MYC/BCL2 DHL that will be useful for both in vitro and in vivo studies of DHL pathogenesis and therapeutics.

27134166|t|Metabolic Symbiosis Enables Adaptive Resistance to Anti-angiogenic Therapy that Is Dependent on mTOR Signaling.
27134166|a|Therapeutic targeting of tumor angiogenesis with VEGF inhibitors results in demonstrable, but transitory efficacy in certain human tumors and mouse models of cancer, limited by unconventional forms of adaptive/evasive resistance. In one such mouse model, potent angiogenesis inhibitors elicit compartmental reorganization of cancer cells around remaining blood vessels. The glucose and lactate transporters GLUT1 and MCT4 are induced in distal hypoxic cells in a HIF1a-dependent fashion, indicative of glycolysis. Tumor cells proximal to blood vessels instead express the lactate transporter MCT1, and p-S6, the latter reflecting mTOR signaling. Normoxic cancer cells import and metabolize lactate, resulting in upregulation of mTOR signaling via glutamine metabolism enhanced by lactate catabolism. Thus, metabolic symbiosis is established in the face of angiogenesis inhibition, whereby hypoxic cancer cells import glucose and export lactate, while normoxic cells import and catabolize lactate. mTOR signaling inhibition disrupts this metabolic symbiosis, associated with upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT2.

28151486|t|Star-PAP, a poly(A) polymerase, functions as a tumor suppressor in an orthotopic human breast cancer model.
28151486|a|Star-PAP is a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase and required for the expression of a select set of mRNAs. However, the pathological role of Star-PAP in cancer largely remains unknown. In this study, we observed decreased expression of Star-PAP in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Ectopic Star-PAP expression inhibited proliferation as well as colony-forming ability of breast cancer cells. In breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP correlated with an improved prognosis. Moreover, by regulating the expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer), Star-PAP induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. The growth of breast cancer xenografts in NOD/SCID mice was also inhibited by the doxycycline-induced Star-PAP overexpression. Furthermore, Star-PAP sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs both in vitro and in vivo. In mammary epithelial cells, Star-PAP knockdown partially transformed these cells and induced them to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These findings suggested that Star-PAP possesses tumor-suppressing activity and can be a valuable target for developing new cancer therapeutic strategies.

25128964|t|Twist 1 regulates the expression of PPARg during hormone-induced 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation: a possible role in obesity and associated diseases.
25128964|a|BACKGROUND: Twist 1 is highly expressed in adipose tissue and has been associated with obesity and related disorders. However, the molecular function of Twist 1 in adipose tissue is unclear. Twist 1 has been implicated in cell lineage determination and differentiation. Therefore, we investigated both the role of Twist 1 in adipocyte precursor mobilization and the relationship of Twist 1 with other molecular determinants of adipocyte differentiation. METHODS: We examined Twist 1 mRNA and protein expression in subcutaneous adipose tissues from diet-induced obese C57/BL6 mice and Wistar rats and in obese patients undergoing liposuction or adipose transplant surgeries. Twist 1 expression was measured on days 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 of 3T3-L1 differentiation in vitro. The role of Twist 1 in adipogenesis was explored using retroviral interference of Twist 1 expression. Adipokine secretion was evaluated using a RayBioR Biotin Label-based Adipokine Array. RESULTS: Twist 1 mRNA and protein levels were reduced in diet-induced obese mice and rats and in obese humans. Twist 1 was upregulated during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation in vitro, beginning from the fourth day of differentiation induction. Retroviral interference of Twist 1 expression did not significantly impair lipid formation; however, retroviral interference induced PPARg mRNA and protein expression on day 4 of differentiation induction. Adipokine array analyses revealed increased secretion of CXCR4 (19.55-fold), VEGFR1 (92.13-fold), L-21 R (63.55-fold), and IL-12 R beta 1 (59.66-fold) and decreased secretion of VEGFR3 (0.01-fold), TSLP R (0.071-fold), MIP-1 gamma (0.069-fold), TNF RI/TNFRSF1A (0.09-fold), and MFG-E8 (0.06-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Twist 1 is a regulator of adipocyte gene expression although it is not likely to regulate differentiation. We identified PPARg as a potential target of Twist 1 and found variation in the secretion of multiple adipokines, which might indicate a prospective mechanism linking Twist 1 expression with obesity or associated diseases.
